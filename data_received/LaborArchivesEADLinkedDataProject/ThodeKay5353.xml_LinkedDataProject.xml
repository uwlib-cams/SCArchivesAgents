		  of the Seattle Urban League's Health and Welfare Department from 1968 to 1983.
		  She subsequently worked as a planner for the King County Health Planning
		  Council, a subarea council of the Puget Sound Health Systems Agency. Throughout
		  her career she was tireless in advocating and lobbying for the rights of
		  welfare recipients and the poor, and testified frequently before local, state,
		  and federal government bodies. She was active in the Puget Sound Chapter of the
		  National Association of Social Workers, serving as Newsletter Editor,
		  President, and delegate to NASW's national assembly several times. At the
		  organization's national level she was chair of the National Committee on
		  Women's Issues and was a member of the National Social Policy and Action
		  Cabinet. She was named Social Worker of the Year by the Puget Sound Council in
		  1972, and by the Washington State Chapter in 1979. She was also active in the
		  Washington Association for Social Welfare, presenting a paper at its conference
		  on The Worth of Work in, 1977, and serving as keynote speaker at its 1978
		  legislative conference. She was elected President of the organization in
		  October 1979. She initiated the group Washington State Friends of Welfare
		  Rights to support the activities of the Washington State and National Welfare
		  Rights Organizations, and served on the boards of the Washington Coalition for
		  a National Health Program, the Council of Planning Affiliates Legislative
		  Comittee, Neighborhood Health Centers, the Fair Budget Action Campagn, the
		  Welfare Rights Organizing Committee, and People for Fair Taxes. She also served
		  on advisory committees for entities including King County Hospital, the
		  Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, and Seattle City
		  Light. Thode's husband Bob Thode appeared before the anti-Left Canwell
		  Committee during the Red Scare of the 1950s--partly because of her activism.

				testimony and other materials produced with and on behalf of the organizations
				with which she worked; the largest proportion dates from her years with the
				Seattle Urban League. The record series "Fact Sheets" in the Seattle Urban
				League subgroup was created to include materials that Ms. Thode had labeled
				"Fact Sheets and Summaries" and includes her yearly "Washington State Welfare
				Facts" information sheets as well as background material gathered for its
				preparation, and other fact sheets on related topics. She continued her fact
				sheets after leaving the Seattle Urban League; the later fact sheets are in
				Personal Papers and other subgroups. Conference files and a limited amount of
				correspondence also are present, much of the latter in connection either with
				requesting information from government bodies and other organizations, or
				sending information to local and national legislators. The greater part of the
				remaining material (clippings, reports, ephemera and so forth) consists of
				supporting material for Ms. Thode's writings, testimony and lobbying efforts.
				The Speeches and Writings series in the Seattle Urban League subgroup includes
				Kay Thode's notes on Seattle Urban League staff in the late 1960s and early
				1970s; these were written as commentary on the draft finding aid for the
				Seattle Urban League records, which are also housed in Special Collections
				Division (Box 3, Folder 29). A subject file in the Washington State Friends of
				Welfare Rights subgroup contains materials relating to Elaine McLean, a welfare
				activist (and former welfare recipient) who intitiated the Tacoma-based Welfare
				Rights Organizing Committee and includes McLean's poetry and her book
				manuscript, 
			 <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Carrots and Sticks and the Employable
				Welfare Poor.</title>The personal papers subgroup contains a subject file
			 titled "Uncompensated Care," covering Ms. Thode's work on that issue in
			 conjunction with several different groups and organizations in the early 1980s.
			 Other subgroups include professional organizations to which Thode belonged,
			 such as the Puget Sound Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers,
			 or groups with which she was active, such as Toward an Open Society, the Fair
			 Budget Action Campaign, and Washington State Friends of Welfare Rights.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict encodinganalog="506"><p>Open to all users.</p></accessrestrict><acqinfo encodinganalog="541" id="a19"><p>Donated by Kay Thode in two installments in 2003.</p></acqinfo><c02 level="series"><did><unitid type="uwsc">Series 1</unitid><container type="box-folder"/><unittitle>Personal Papers</unittitle><unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1972-1996</unitdate></did><c03 level="subseries"><did><container type="box-folder">1/1</container><unittitle>Incoming Letters</unittitle><unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1983, 1986-1989</unitdate></did></c03><c03 level="subseries"><did><container type="box-folder"/><unittitle>Writings</unittitle><unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian"/></did><c04 level="file"><did><container type="box-folder">1/2</container><unittitle>Letters to Editors,
