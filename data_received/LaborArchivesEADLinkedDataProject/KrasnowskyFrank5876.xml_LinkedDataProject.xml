		<p>Frank Krasnowsky is a labor, political, and civil rights activist.
		  Krasnowsky was an organizer and health and safety committee officer for the
		  United Steelworkers of America in the Bethlehem Steel plant in Tacoma,
		  Washington. There, he worked with other union activists including Eugene Dennet
		  to make the existing union contract more powerful for the union members at
		  Bethlehem--particulary in regards to health and safety. </p> 
		<p>At one time, Krasnowsky was married to fellow socialist Clara Fraser.
		  They divorced, and she left the SWP to form the Freedom Socialist Party. </p> 
		<p>Krasnowsky's mother was a Jewish and Yiddish anarchist and his father,
		  Harry Paxton Howard, was from an old American family and a member of the
		  Industrial Workers of the World. His parents met in Chicago, where his mother
		  was a garment worker and they were part of the same IWW/anarchist circles. When
		  they left the US together in 1917 for Russia to aid the Russian Revolution, and
		  en route Frank took his mother's name--Krasnowsky--rather than his father's to
		  allow them to get back into Russia more easily. Instead of staying in Russia,
		  they lived in Yokahama, Japan for 4 years where Krasnowsky's father worked as
		  an editor of the newspapers Russia Today and New Russia.</p> 
		<p>Krasnowsky is also a member of the local Jewish American community. He
		  co-chaired the Seattle chapter of the National Yiddish Club and performed as
		  part of the musical duo Chutzpah. He is also the published author of short
		  stories and poems.</p>
