         <p>The Freedom Socialist party is a revolutionary socialist feminist
		  organization that does intersectional organizing against racism, sexism,
		  homophobia, and labor exploitation. The FSP's political analysis sees women's
		  leadership and political action as decisive to social change and trains women
		  to lead in these campaigns. The immediate forerunner of the Freedom Socialist
		  Party began with the Kirk-Kaye tendency within the Socialist Workers Party, led
		  by Dick Fraser (Kirk) and Clara Fraser (Kaye) who were married at the time. The
		  Kirk-Kaye tendency had a distinct analysis on civil rights, derived from the
		  theory of "revolutionary integrationism," and took a more sympathetic towards
		  China as a worker's state than the SWP. </p>
         <p>The Freedom Socialist Party was founded in 1966, and had a differing
		  analysis from the SWP's on black nationalist views of Malcolm X and the SWP's
		  orientation toward the labor leaders rather than rank and file workers, and its
		  relationships to the anti-Vietnam War movement, and its dismissive attitude
		  toward the emerging feminist movement. The FSP advocated class solidarity
		  between black and white workers, centered their revolutionary analysis around
		  women's emancipation, and urged the anti-war movement to support the socialist,
		  anti-colonial aims of the Vietnamese Revolution. FSP leaders Clara Fraser
		  (1923–1998) and Gloria Martin (1916–1995) built on the socialist analysis of
		  women's oppression to create a Leninist party that is "socialist-feminist" in
		  ideology and practice. The party views the liberation struggles of women,
		  people of color and sexual minorities (such as gay people) as intrinsic to
		  working-class revolt, and it looks to these specially-oppressed sectors of
		  society to provide revolutionary leadership. Women comprise a predominant part
		  of the party leadership. Overall, membership is diverse and is composed of all
		  genders and races. The party characterizes its National Comrades of Color
		  Caucus as offering the party's diverse ranks of people of color an opportunity
		  to work together as a team to grow as leaders and provide direction for the
		  party's work in people of color movements.</p>
         <p>The party has branches in a number of U.S. cities, as well as one in
		  Melbourne, Australia. The Freedom Socialist newspaper is produced six times a
		  year. Red Letter Press publishes books and pamphlets for the party. The FSP is
		  affiliated with Radical Women, which is an autonomous socialist feminist
		  organization. [Source:
