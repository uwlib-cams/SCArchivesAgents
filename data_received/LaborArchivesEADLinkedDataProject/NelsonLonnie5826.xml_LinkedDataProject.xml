		<p>Lonnie Nelson was born in Seattle Aug. 20, 1932, and named Madelon Sue
		  by her parents Alma Viola Nickerson Nelson and Burt Gale Nelson. Her father was
		  a founding member of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and a
		  leader of the Communist Party of Washington State. </p> 
		<p>In high school in 1948 she organized Young Progressives and was active
		  in the Progressive Party campaign of Henry Wallace. She joined the Communist
		  Party in 1951 at a time when CP members, including her father, were being
		  blacklisted and harassed by the FBI. </p> 
		<p>She gathered signatures on the Stockholm Peace Appeal in the 1950s
		  when Cold War elements were itching for war against the Soviet Union or China.
		  That commitment to world peace continued in the years of solidarity with Cuba
		  and Vietnam when she helped mobilize peace protests. </p> 
		<p>She was especially proud of a trip she took to Spain where veterans of
		  the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, including her uncle, were honored as fighters
		  against Franco fascism. </p> 
		<p>Nelson served as chairperson of a petition campaign against the
		  McCarthy-era loyalty oath, which in 1972 presented 10,000 signatures to the
		  state attorney general in Olympia. Later, she served on a committee defending
		  the Black Panther Party. </p> 
		<p>An admirer of the Native American Indian people, she joined in the
		  campaign to win restoration of the tribes' fishing rights. She befriended many
		  of the Native American Indians in that struggle, working closely with Maiselle
		  Bridges, a leader of the Nisqually tribe. Victory was won when Judge George
		  Boldt handed down his landmark ruling 40 years ago that the tribes were
		  entitled to half the salmon catch. </p> 
		<p>Her love of the Indian peoples and their struggles led her to join the
		  "Trail of Broken Treaties" to Washington, D.C., in 1972, when the American
		  Indian Movement occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters. She helped
		  raise funds for the legal defense of the occupiers. She knew Hank Adams and
		  other Native American Indian leaders personally and interviewed them for
		  articles in the Daily World during that sit-in. </p> 
		<p>Lonnie Nelson's first love was always the labor movement. During her
		  working years, she was employed at a day care center at Providence Hospital for
		  nearly six years. She worked to organize the workers into SEIU Local 6. She
		  helped establish the Seattle branch of the Coalition of Labor Union Women
		  (CLUW), heading up the CLUW Public Works Jobs Committee. </p> 
		<p>She was arrested three times for civil disobedience: during the Indian
		  fishing rights struggle, against South African apartheid, and in the mid-1990s
		  against Republican Newt Gingrich's "Contract on America" Medicare cuts. </p>
