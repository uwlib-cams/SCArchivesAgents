			 <p>This collection of records, publications and artifacts documents
				the various union activities of Jackie Boschok. While most of Jackie’s personal
				records are from the 1980s, the bulk of professional records and publications
				are from the 1990s-2000s. The records show the widespread involvement Jackie
				Boschok had across numerous unions and community groups, including her
				particular emphasis on the progression of women’s rights within both the
				workplace and the union. The largest part of the collections is Series I:
				Jackie Boschok Professional Records, which details the day-to-day activities,
				as well as special events, for unions and other labor coalitions of which
				Jackie Boschok served as a member and/or officer. At the end of Series I is
				Subseries B: Boeing Company Records, which highlights the relationship of
				Boeing and its employees, as well as detailing the Employee Community Fund,
				which consists of voluntary employee paycheck deductions donated to non-profits
				in the local community. Series II: Jackie Boschok Personal Records highlight
				Jackie’s personal employment, education, politics and union involvement. Of
				particular note is Subseries C: Jackie Boschok’s Political Involvement, which
				show her support for women’s rights, including the Equal Rights Amendment and a
				women’s right to choose. Also of interest is Subseries D: Seattle Goodwill
				Games/Rotary District 503 Goodwill Exchange gives a glimpse into the experience
				of housing Russian house guests during the Seattle Goodwill Games of 1990.
				Series III: Publications consists of journals, newspapers and newsletters
				published by the International Association of Machninists (IAM), the Coalition
				of Local Union Women (CLUW) and Boeing. These publications give insight into
				the pertinent issues concerning women in unions as well as unions at large at
				both local and national issues. Series IV: Educational Materials makes up a
				large part of the collection, with materials relating to various types of
				education pertinent to a union members: union (negotiating/collective
				bargaining), legal, workplace, technology and sexual harassment/domestic
				violence/workplace violence. Series V: Artifacts consists of five full boxes of
				artifacts, the bulk of which are related to the International Association of
				Machinists (IAM), but the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), United Way and
				Boeing are also represented. Of particular note is Subseries H: Strike
				Artifacts, which includes official IAM press scrapbooks and picket signs
				relating to strikes that occurred between 1989 and 2003. Also worth noting are
				the hundreds of pro-union and women’s rights buttons/pins and stickers in
				Subseries D and E, which were collected by Jackie between 1980 and 2010.</p>
