		<p>Earl George (1894-1985) of the International Longshore and Warehouse
		  Union, Local 9 (Seattle) dedicated his life to tireless work on behalf of the
		  ILWU and progressive causes, most passionately in the struggle to end racial
		  discrimination.</p> 
		<p>George was born in Denver in 1894. He once said that “growing up Black
		  in this country gives you a pretty good political education.” Early on, the
		  struggles of Denver’s Black community and the violent Colorado miners’ strikes
		  shaped his thinking. George studied math and chemistry at the University of
		  Denver before being drafted into the segregated Army in 1917 and sent to Fort
		  Lewis in the Puget Sound. George arrived in time to participate in the Seattle
		  General Strike of 1919. Sixty-five thousand workers in Seattle walked out in
		  solidarity with 35,000 shipyard workers who were immersed in a struggle for
		  wage increases. The action shut down the entire city.</p> 
		<p>Like other African Americans, George was excluded from many jobs as
		  well as many unions. In the 1920s and 1930s, he worked in a number of low paid,
		  non-unionized jobs in the service sector, peppered with periods of
		  unemployment. He found work as a steward aboard coastwise vessels, where he
		  joined the Industrial Workers of the World, a militant labor union founded in
		  1905 which rallied under the banner, “An injury to one is an injury to
		  all.”</p> 
		<p>When the Great Depression hit in 1929, George marched in Seattle’s
		  streets with the Unemployed Citizens League and the Workers’ Alliance, an
		  organization which fought to get collective bargaining rights for people
		  working on Federal projects. He also helped build the Washington Commonwealth
		  Federation and the Washington Pension Union, whose influence in Washington
		  State politics helped pass the state’s first pension bill in 1939. George
		  joined ILWU Local 9 as a warehouseman in 1938. While working as a warehouseman,
		  he continued to dedicate himself to ending discrimination and bettering the
		  lives of workers</p> 
		<p>In 1948, he worked on a campaign that succeeded in forcing
		  Seattle-area grocery stores to hire African Americans. A dedicated ILWU member,
		  he participated in the 1948 Pacific Coast Strike, and in 1950 became the first
		  black president of Local 9. While serving in local office, George and then ILWU
		  Regional Director Bill Chester (later ILWU International Vice President) were
		  among a number of African American unionists who helped found the National
		  Negro Labor Council (NNLC). A powerful but short-lived labor organization, the
		  NNLC focused its goals on ending racial discrimination in industry and racism
		  in unions. They campaigned to get unions to organize black workers and were
		  successful in getting a number of unions to call for non-discrimination clauses
		  in their labor contracts. Earl George was a survivor of racism and also a
		  strong combatant against it. Like many labor activists of his time, he also
		  faced bitter red baiting</p> 
		<p>Along with ILWU President Harry Bridges and other members of the
		  union, George was scapegoated for his political views. In the early 1950s,
		  former Communist Party member Barbara Hartle testified at the Velde Committee
		  hearings, part of the House Un-American Activities Committee, and named Earl
		  and his wife Vivian along with over 200 other possible members of the Communist
		  Party. </p> 
		<p>Earl himself was subpoenaed to appear before the committee to answer
		  whether he was a Party member. He recalled that “the committee was so
		  self-righteous. They were going to save the world from dangerous folks like me.
		  What did I have to say to them? I took the Fifth Amendment and walked out.”
		  Earl George was a friend to legendary performer, political progressive, civil
		  rights activist, and honorary ILWU member Paul Robeson. In 1952, the Seattle
		  City Council barred Robeson from performing at the Civic Auditorium. George
		  came to his aid, organizing protests in Robeson’s support.</p> 
		<p>He took similar action when the US State Department revoked Robeson’s
		  passport, preventing him from touring outside the US because of his political
		  beliefs. Lonnie Nelson, a longtime Seattle- area activist and member of ILWU
		  Auxiliary #3 who was close to George, stated that he “was one of the people in
		  the ILWU who represented a wide understanding of life and industry. He was a
		  working class intellectual.”</p> 
		<p>George remained with Local 9 until 1961, when he retired from work.
		  However, retirement did not mean an end to his commitment to the ILWU and labor
		  and civil rights activism. As soon as he left the active workforce, George
		  became a committed and active member of the Seattle Pensioners Association,
		  where he variously served as Trustee, Secretary, and Secretary-Treasurer.</p> 
		<p> George was integral in organizing freedom schools during the school
		  boycott to protest segregation in 1966. He also became a well-known
		  photographer, chronicling union picket lines, demonstrations, and rallies for
		  social justice through his camera’s lens. The ILWU International appointed him
		  as a correspondent/photographer for the Dispatcher, and a number of his images
		  appeared in the paper in the 1970s and 1980s. In an interview taken shortly
		  before his death, George stated that “for ninety years I’ve been outraged by
		  injustice wherever it rears its ugly head. All the movements I’ve been part of
		  had one important goal: a little more bread, slightly thicker broth, and a
		  bigger piece of the pie for everyone.”</p>

		<p>This collection encompasses the latter parts of the life of Earl
		  George relating to his working life. They are arranged into three series, one
		  of personal papers, one of photographs, and one of buttons. Most of the
		  materials date from 1930-1985.</p> 
		<p>The papers collection include personal correspondence, birthday cards
		  and a guestbook from George’s 80th birthday celebration in 1974, and a World
		  War I veteran Union Labor Barracks 763 Seattle hat.</p> 
		<p>The photograph collection cover images from the 1960-1985, showing
		  picketing, parades, photos of the African-American community, and personal
		  photos of Earl George. Photographs of labor, social justice, and civil rights
		  events taken by George, many of which appeared in the Communist Party USA
		  paper, The People's World and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union's
		  paper, The Dispatcher.</p>
