		<p>Founded in 1933 as the Cannery Workers and Farm Laborers Union, Local
		  18257 of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), it represented Alaska salmon
		  cannery workers and farm workers. In 1937, the union became Cannery Workers and
		  Farm Laborers Union, Local 7 of the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and
		  Allied Workers of America of the Congress of Industrial Organziations (CIO). In
		  1945, Local 7 became affiliated with the Food, Tobacco, and Agricultural
		  Workers of America (CIO). In 1951 the union became Local 37 of International
		  Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, and ca. 1987 it became Region 37 of
		  IBU/ILWU. The membership historically was Filipino American cannery
		  workers.</p> 
		<p>The Cannery Workers' and Farm Laborers' Union was organized June 19,
		  1933 in Seattle to represent the primarily Filipino-American laborers who
		  worked in the Alaska salmon canneries. Filipino Alaskeros first appeared in the
		  canneries around 1911. In the 1920s as exclusionary immigration laws went into
		  effect, they replaced the Japanese, who had replaced the Chinese in the
		  canneries. Workers were recruited through labor contractors who were paid to
		  provide a work crew for the summer canning season. The contractor paid workers
		  wages and other expenses. This system led to many abuses and harsh working
		  conditions from which grew the movement toward unionization.</p> 
		<p>The CWFLU, under the leadership of its first President, Virgil
		  Duyungan, was chartered as Local 19257 by the American Federation of Labor in
		  1933. On December 1, 1936 an agent of a labor contractor murdered Duyungan and
		  Secretary Aurelio Simon. Despite this setback, the union was able to win a
		  hiring hall and end the contract labor system in 1937. After Duyungan's death,
		  Conrad Espe, A Norwegian-American labor organizer, took the leading role in the
		  union. Under the leadership of Duyungan and Espe, the CWFLU made numerous
		  attempts to organize farm workers during the winter months. Farm Division
		  organizers attempted to organize workers in Yakima, Kent, Everett, Bainbridge
		  Island and the White River area, but were often met with harsh opposition from
		  local officials and vigilantes.</p> 
		<p>Local 18257 came into conflict with the AFL, in 1937 when the parent
		  body, attempting to separate the union along racial lines, recognized a
		  Japanese local organized by Clarence Arai. Local 18257 successfully retained
		  negotiation rights and dispatched its workers in 1937 despite pickets set up by
		  the rival group. Bitterness toward the AFL resulted from the incidents and led
		  to a November 4 vote by the Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco locals to
		  affiliate with the newly formed United Cannery, Agricultural, Packinghouse and
		  Allied Workers of America-CIO (UCAPAWA). In Seattle, Local 18257 became
		  UCAPAWA, Local 7and in San Francisco and Portland Cannery Workers unions also
		  joined UCAPAWA Opponents of reaffiliation, led by John Ayamo and called the
		  "defeated candidates party," received the old 18257 charter and challenged
		  Local 7 for the right to represent cannery workers. On May 4, 1938 the issue
		  was settled in Local 7's favor in a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
		  supervised election. The industry representative, Canned Salmon Industry Inc.,
		  subsequently recognized the victorious union. Ayamo later formed another AFL
		  union, the Alaska Fish Cannery Workers, under the jurisdiction of the Seafarers
		  International Union. In 1937 also, the CWFLU merged with a rival, the Filipino
		  Protective Association. I.R. Cabatit was president of the union during the
		  period of rivalry with the AFL. When he was succeeded by Trinidad Rojo in 1939,
		  the CWFLU, Local 7 was on the verge of bankruptcy. It was discovered that
		  officers had been selling membership cards, misappropriating funds and
		  neglecting their duties. Rojo cut expenses and returned the union to a sound
		  financial footing.</p> 
		<p>The years of World War II depleted the union's ranks and brought
		  government-imposed emergency controls, including a ban on strikes and a wage
		  freeze. Although union members returned after the war, the union entered one of
		  its most turbulent decades, one marked by internal struggle and external
		  pressure.</p> 
		<p>The canning industry trend since the 1930s had been to move company
		  headquarters to Seattle in order to cut down on transportation costs to Alaska.
		  In response, Local 5 of San Francisco and Local 226 of Portland merged with
		  Local 7 in 1943. In the same period, the industry also consolidated into a
		  permanent organization, the Alaska Salmon Industry Inc., which functioned as
		  principal party in contract negotiations.</p> 
		<p> During the war, the Caballeros de Dimas Alang, a Filipino fraternal
		  organization, emerged as a powerful faction that came to control many positions
		  within the union. Corruption and neglect in the union led disgruntled members
		  to found the Rank and File Committee in 1946. The tension in the union erupted
		  into conflict on February 9, 1947 when union Vice President, Max Gonzales,
		  pulled a gun and shot at, but missed, one of the reformers, Matias Lagunilla.
		  This incident precipitated an investigation by the new International, the Food,
		  Tobacco, Agricultural and Allied Workers Union of America, which had succeeded
		  UCAPAWA earlier that year. The international expelled Gonzales, suspended the
		  other officers and set up an administrative board with Trinidad Rojo as
		  administrative President. The ousted officers formed the Seafood Workers Union
		  and launched a membership drive. The SFWU attempted unsuccessfully to use the
		  courts to dissolve Local 7 and to take over its funds. In 1948, however, after
		  the NLRB declared it to be a company union, the SFWU merged with the Alaska
		  Fish Cannery Workers Union (AFL), a holdover from the dual union battle of
		  1938, and petitioned the NLRB for representation elections. The NLRB denied
		  representation to Local 7, ruling that the FTA International had not filed
		  non-Communist affidavits, and set an election for April 1949. The campaign was
		  bitter, with Local 7 accused of being a Communist union by the opposition.
		  Before the election, U.S. Immigration officials arrested Local 7's business
		  agent, Ernesto Mangaoang and charged him with being a Communist. Chris
		  Mensalvas, elected to the presidency of Local 7 in 1949, was also arrested.
		  After the CIO, fearing charges of Communism, expelled the FTA International,
		  some Local 7 officers resigned and disassociated themselves from the union. In
		  1950 a group of these officers, "defeated candidates", and other cannery
		  workers joined to form another union, ostensibly "red-free" Local 77,
		  UPAWA-CIO, with Vincent Navea as its president. Meanwhile, in 1950, Local 7
		  affiliated with the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union
		  (ILWU) and became Local 7-C. In a NLRB representation election in 1950, Local
		  7-C finally won collective bargaining rights, defeating Local 77 and the AFCWU.
		  In 1951 the union signed a four-year closed shop contract with the canning
		  industry. Local 7-C subsequently became ILWU, Local 37 .</p> 
		<p>Charges of Communist infiltration continued to haunt Local 37 in the
		  1950s and Ernesto Mangaoang barely escaped deportation. From the late 1950s to
		  1977, Local 37 was led by President Gene Navarro. Navarro ran the union on the
		  "compadre" system, a cultural system of personal obligations, allegiances and
		  favors. During the 1970s the cannery work force experienced an influx of new
		  laborers - recently arrived Filipino immigrants, young Filipino­Americans and
		  non-Filipino men and women. The new and younger workers were dissatisfied with
		  work conditions and lack of support by the Navarro leadership. As a result,
		  some members including Silme and Nemesio Domingo and Gene Viernes, formed a new
		  organization outside the union: the Alaska Cannery Workers Association (ACWA).
		  Their purpose was to pursue their grievances through legal channels. In 1974,
		  numerous candidates who belonged to ACWA confronted the union after failing to
		  win election and were expelled. After Gene Navarro died in 1976 and was
		  replaced by Tony Baruso, the young reform workers regained their membership.
		  Upon their return, they formed the Rank and File Committee of Local 37. In the
		  1978 elections, they won 9 positions on the Executive Council, and subsequently
		  won delegate positions and posts on the grievance committee. In 1979, reform
		  forces succeeded in the recall of Secretary­Treasurer Ponce Torres. In the fall
		  of 1980, the reform group gained control of the union with Silme Domingo
		  winning the post of Secretary-Treasurer and Gene Viernes the job of dispatcher.
		  On June 1, 1981, Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes were shot and killed in the
		  union hall. Two young Filipinos, Pompeyo Benito Guloy and Jimmy Bulosan Ramil,
		  were subsequently convicted of the crime. Local 37 president, Tony Baruso was
		  also a suspect in the crime, and was eventually charged, tried, and, in 1991,
		  convicted of planning the murders. Before Baruso's arrest, an internal union
		  investigation looked into his involvement in the crime and also into charges of
		  election fraud. The Rank and File Committee led a successful campaign to oust
		  Baruso after he was found guilty of election fraud. In 1982, the union
		  overwhelmingly elected a reform slate of candidates, including Terri Mast,
		  widow of Silme Domingo, as President. In the 1980s, the union changed its name
		  again to IBU/ILWU, Region 37 reflecting a merger of the Longshoremen's Union
		  with the Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific.</p>

		<p>The records of the Cannery Union were in poor order when transferred
		  to the Libraries from the union's former hall. There was no consistent filing
		  system through the years and much was unfiled. The records had been stored in
		  the open and had accumulated much dust. What file headings existed have been
		  incorporated into the current arrangement. The accession was divided into
		  segments corresponding to the union's various names and affiliations in order
		  to expedite processing of the records. Certain record groups, such as minutes,
		  were excepted from this division and were instead kept together in a single
		  sequence (Record Group 1). Membership, financial, and dispatching records have
		  been separated, placed last on the inventory, but not processed.</p> 
		<p>In their original state, most of the files could not be identified as
		  those of a single officer. They included records primarily of the union's
		  secretary, in mixture with correspondence of the president, other officers and
		  other records. There were, however, some segments, which were distinct files
		  accumulated by a single individual. These papers have been kept intact as
		  subgroups within the appropriate chronological division. In Record Group 4, for
		  instance, there are subgroups for the Regional Director/International
		  Organizers Robert Kinney and Wendal Phillips and the Oregon State
		  Director/International Organizer, Frank T. Patterson. These men were not
		  elected officials but worked for the union. The papers in their subgroups were
		  separately and uniformly labeled files.</p> 
		<p>Several cartons of papers received from the union labeled, "Gene's
		  Research" were papers generated or collected by Gene Viernes. Those which were
		  original records of the union, pre­ dating Viernes' involvement, were
		  re-integrated into the main body of the records in the appropriate section. The
		  remaining papers in the Viernes subgroup consist of papers collected or copied
		  by Viernes in his research on the history of the union and papers generated or
		  accumulated by Viernes as an active member of the union. The photocopied union
		  records in Viernes' subgroup may be duplicates of records elsewhere in the
		  accession.</p> 
		<p> A small subgroup was created for papers of Victoria Velasco which
		  were found in various places throughout the records. These papers primarily
		  reflect Velasco's involvement with other unions and a small amount related to
		  non-union activities. A more substantial amount of Velasco's papers was given
		  to the Libraries by his widow in 1970 and accessioned as Victoria Velasco ace.
		  Acc. # 1435-003.</p> 
		<p>Subgroups were created within each part for the union's committees and
		  other organizational units. Another group of subgroups consists of records
		  reflecting the union's participation in various external organizations, such as
		  the Maritime Federation of the Pacific, various CIO bodies, and Filipino
		  organizations.</p> 
		<p>Within each part of the records, a filing system was devised for the
		  union's correspondence. First, a division was made between correspondence
		  within the union and external correspondence. Internal correspondence was
		  divided between members correspondence (usually separate in the original
		  order), correspondence among officers, correspondence with branches, delegates
		  and the parent international. Member's correspondence is arranged by year, all
		  other correspondence is arranged alphabetically The outgoing letters series
		  consists of flyers and other mailings sent mainly to members.</p> 
		<p>Subject Series are files with the original subject headings. The
		  elections series includes ballots, correspondence, ephemera, tallies and
		  related material. They are arranged by year. The negotiations, contracts, and
		  agreements series are also arranged by year. Although the minutes of the union
		  were consolidated in Record Group 1: MINUTES, minutes of other organizations
		  are found in other parts of the arrangement.</p>

		<p>The local's entire history through 1981 is documented well, but to
		  varying extents, by minutes, correspondence, case files, court papers and other
		  record series. The files of Local 7 (Parts III and IV) are the most extensive
		  portions of the papers. The earliest years of the union are better documented
		  than the period of Local 37, the longest era. Little correspondence ofLocal37's
		  presidents or other leader is present. Records for the 1960's and 1970's are
		  especially sparse.</p> 
		<p> Contrary to expectations, no records of Local 5 and 226 in San
		  Francisco and Portland were found. These locals were ordered to send their
		  records to Seattle when they were amalgamated with Local 7 in 1943. Local 7's
		  records do include numerous copies of minutes and correspondence of these
		  locals, which were sent to Seattle from time to time and also extensive files
		  of correspondence with other locals.</p>

				divided between members correspondence (usually separate in the original
				order), correspondence among officers, correspondence with branches, delegates
				and the parent international. Member's correspondence is arranged by year, all
				other correspondence is arranged alphabetically The outgoing letters series
				consists of flyers and other mailings sent mainly to members.</p>

			 <p>Within each record group, a filing system was devised for the
				union's correspondence. First, a division was made between correspondence
				within the union and external correspondence. Internal correspondence was
				divided between members correspondence (usually separate in the original
				order), correspondence among officers, correspondence with branches, delegates
				and the parent international. Member's correspondence is arranged by year, all
				other correspondence is arranged alphabetically The outgoing letters series
				consists of flyers and other mailings sent mainly to members.</p>

			 <p>In their original state, most of the files could not be identified
				as those of a single officer. They included records primarily of the union's
				secretary, in mixture with correspondence of the president, other officers and
				other records. There were, however, some segments, which were distinct files
				accumulated by a single individual. These papers have been kept intact as
				subgroups within the appropriate chronological division. In Record Group 4,
				there are subgroups for the Regional Director/International Organizers Robert
				Kinney and Wendal Phillips and the Oregon State Director/International
				Organizer, Frank T. Patterson. These men were not elected officials but worked
				for the union. The papers in their subgroups were separately and uniformly
				labeled files.</p> 
			 <p>Within each record group, a filing system was devised for the
				union's correspondence. First, a division was made between correspondence
				within the union and external correspondence. Internal correspondence was
				divided between members correspondence (usually separate in the original
				order), correspondence among officers, correspondence with branches, delegates
				and the parent international. Member's correspondence is arranged by year, all
				other correspondence is arranged alphabetically The outgoing letters series
				consists of flyers and other mailings sent mainly to members.</p>
