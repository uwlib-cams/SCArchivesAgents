		<p>Washington Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (WashCOSH) was
		  founded in 1992 at a meeting of union and safety and health activists at the
		  International Association of Machinists, Lodge 751 union hall. The goal was to
		  improve workplace safety and health. Funding came from subcontracting on grants
		  to the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees and the
		  Alice Hamilton Committee for Safety and Health from the National Institute for
		  Environmental Health Sciences. </p> 
		<p> WashCOSH was involved in various projects over its history, including
		  Ergonomics at a Buffalo Industries fabric recycling plant organized by
		  Teamsters. The organization also offered a program of Painting Hazards
		  Certification Training and other "painters' upgrade classes" for the Painters
		  Advanced Training Institute at the Duwamish Branch of South Seattle Community
		  College. Other trainings included Confined Space Entry Training and Hazardous
		  Materials Emergency Response Training for the American Federation of State,
		  County, and Municipal Employees. As well, the organization was involved with
		  annual Workers' Memorial Day Events. WashCOSH published a quarterly newsletter,
		  a guide called "Pollution Prevention for Construction Painting: A guide to help
		  protect painters, the public and the environment" and organized an annual
		  conferences including "Ergonomics, Safety, and Health in Construction,
		  September 12-13, 1994" and "A Labor Union Response to Violence in the
		  Workplace, June 10th, 1995"</p> 
		<p>WashCOSH created a multi-organizational governance committee, the
		  WISHA Workplace Violence Committee. The executive board was made up of
		  representatives from many unions, including Diane Zahn from the United Food and
		  Commercial Workers (the first board president); Bill Anderson of the
		  International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (Board President); Roger
		  Yockey of United Food and Commercial Workers; and Jay Herzmark (Trustee, Board
		  President) of AFSCME. Other unions represented on the board included
		  International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Office and Professional
		  Employees International Union.</p> 
		<p>The first employee of WashCOSH was Anna Bachmann, who was hired as the
		  Training Director in April 1993. She was later joined by Mark Catlin in the
		  summer of 1993, who was the Director/Industrial Hygienist. Jay Herzmark
		  replaced Catlin at the beginning of 1998. WashCOSH went out of business in the
		  summer of 1998 because of tax issues.</p>

		<p>These materials were collected by Jay Herzmark during his work with
		  the Washington Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (WashCOSH). During
		  his time with WashCOSH, Herzmark served as training director, trustee, and
		  board president. Materials include a banner reading "WashCOSH: Organizing for
		  SAFETY &amp; HEALTH". Bumper stickers advocating worker health and safety, a
		  listing of the board of directors and staff, materials from conferences and
		  trainings including programs, an overview brochure on the organization, and an
		  issue of WashCOSH's newsetter from 1995. </p>
