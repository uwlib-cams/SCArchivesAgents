		<p>John Caughlan was a Seattle attorney and civil rights leader.</p> 
		<p>John Caughlan was born in Missouri in 1909, the son of a Methodist
		  clergyman. The Caughlan family moved to Eastern Washington in 1911, living
		  chiefly in Ellensburg, and then to Seattle where Caughlan graduated from
		  Ballard High School and earned a B.A. at the University of Washington. In the
		  early 1930s he enrolled briefly in a graduate program in English literature at
		  Yale University but, feeling the discipline to be removed from the issues of
		  the day (the problems of the Great Depression and the proposed solutions of the
		  New Deal), he enrolled instead in Harvard Law School, graduating in 1935. </p> 
		<p>Caughlan returned to Seattle in 1937 after a short stint in New York.
		  He worked briefly for a law firm but was fired after refusing to withdraw from
		  a case in which he represented the Communist Party in a dispute with the city,
		  which had revoked the Party's lease for the Civic Auditorium. In 1938 Caughlan
		  became a deputy prosecutor for King County, although he took leave from this
		  position to represent the Grays Habor Civil Rights Committee as they
		  investigated the destruction of a public hall in Aberdeen, Washington. He also
		  represented CIO official Dick Law at the inquest into the death of his wife,
		  labor activist Laura Law. </p> 
		<p>Caughlan returned to the King County Prosecutor's Office in 1940, but
		  was informed that he would only be permitted to resume work there if he would
		  publicly denounce the Soviet Union. He refused to do so, was dismissed, and
		  spent the rest of his career in private practice, having as partners at various
		  times Siegfried Hesse, Leonard Schroeter, C.T. Hatten and Lee A. Holley. </p> 
		<p>Civil liberties and human rights were the two overarching concerns
		  that informed Caughlan's professional activities. In the 1940s and 1950s he
		  represented labor unions, union activists, the Communist Party, the Washington
		  Pension Union, Henry Huff in the Smith Act case of United States v. Henry Huff
		  et al., foreign-born residents facing deportation because of their political
		  activities, and individuals accused of "subversive" or "un-American" activities
		  in cases related to the Smith Act, the McCarran Act, and the McCarran-Walter
		  Act. Hazel Wolf was one of these, threatened with deportation for Commumist
		  Party membership. He also represented, with his partner C.T. "Barry" Hatten, a
		  number of witnesses before the hearings conducted by the Washington State
		  Legislature's Joint Legislative Fact Finding Committee on Un-American
		  Activities, led by Albert F. Canwell, in 1947-1948. He also represented several
		  individuals before the House Committee on Un-American Affairs (HUAC) at its
		  Seattle hearings in 1954, and handled many cases involving screening of Coast
		  Guard personnel. Caughlan had been charged with perjury in 1948, two years
		  after stating in the course of testifying in an immigration case that he was
		  not a member of the Communist Party. He was acquitted, but was himself called
		  before HUAC in 1954 to face the charge again. In 1961 Caughlan was convicted of
		  failure to pay income tax. He served six months in the federal prison camp on
		  McNeil Island and was suspended from practice for thirty days.</p> 
		<p>Five of Caughlan's cases went to the United States Supreme Court; the
		  most significant of these were Herbert Schneider vs. Willard Smith, Commandant,
		  United States Coast Guard, 1968, which invalidated Cost Guard screening
		  procedures for personnel on United States merchant marine vessels, and United
		  States vs. Eugene Robel, 1967, which invalidated a section of the Subversive
		  Activities Control Act (McCarran Act) which had prohibited employment at
		  defense facilities of members of Communist-action organizations. </p> 
		<p> In the 1960s and 1970s Caughlan's focus moved to other issues such as
		  segregation and racial discrimination, and human rights beyond the United
		  States. He travelled to Mississippi in the summer of 1964 with other attorneys
		  to assist in the defense of civil rights activists there; at home in Seattle he
		  was involved in racially charged cases, working with members of the Black
		  Panther Party and protesting inquest procedures (which were later changed) in
		  the inquest into the killing of black activist Larry Ward by Seattle police.
		  Caughlan handled many conscientious objector and Selective Service cases during
		  the Vietnam War. </p> 
		<p>Human rights abuses by governments supported by the United States were
		  an issue of ongoing concern for Caughlan. In 1977 he went to the Philippines as
		  part of a delegation headed by former United States Attorney General Ramsey
		  Clark, on a fact-finding mission to investigate human rights violations by the
		  Marcos regime. During the 1980s he travelled several times to Central America,
		  particularly Nicaragua, participating in a National Lawyers Guild mission in
		  1984 to observe the Nicaraguan elections, and also represented Central American
		  refugees in their immigration cases. After the1981 murders of Filipino union
		  organizers and anti-Marcos activists Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, Caughlan
		  was part of the legal team which represented the families in a civil suit
		  against Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos and the Republic of the Philippines, and
		  which was ultimately successful in proving a connnection between the Marcos
		  regime and the murders. In the 1980s Caughlan was also much concerned with
		  nuclear power issues, serving as part of the legal team that defended
		  environmental activists of the Crabshell Alliance after their demonstrations
		  against the construction of the Satsop nuclear facility. He also helped to
		  draft state initiatives banning the importation of nuclear waste into
		  Washington state, and requiring voter approval of the construction of nuclear
		  facilities. In the late 1980s Caughlan became very involved with the Oakland,
		  California-based Line of March, an organization dedicated to the study and
		  analysis of the history and development of Marxist-Leninist thought.</p> 
		<p>In the 1990s, Caughlan was part of the legal team working on the case
		  of Willem Eickholt, whose boat was seized by United States Customs officials
		  upon his return from a humanitarian mission to Cuba. During this time Caughlan
		  was active in the cause of independent and small party politics, and was
		  involved in the effort to promote Ralph Nader's 1996 presidential campaign.
		  </p> 
		<p>Caughlan served on the board of directors of the American Civil
		  Liberties Union of Washington. He was a member of the National Lawyers Guild
		  from its founding in 1937 and served on its executive board and committee and
		  as chairperson of its International Committee. He was also a founder and an
		  active member of the Seattle chapter of the National Lawyers Guild. Caughlan
		  died on April 17, 1999. </p>

				correspondence, pleadings, reports, newsletters and related material) and
				documents Caughlan's cases from the 1940s through1990s; significant cases
				include United States vs. Robel, Schneider vs. Smith, Domingo et al . vs.
				Ferdinand Marcos et al., conscientious objector cases, and cases involving
				members of the Black Panthers, including Elmer Dixon. Also included is addition
				material related to Caughlan's work on behalf of clients called to testify in
				the Canwell Committee hearings. Subject files document his interest in and
				visits to Mexico, Central America, and the Philippines. Caughlan's partial
				autobiography is in the Writings file; other of his writings are interspersed
				in the papers (their presence has been marked with a note whenever possible).
				Related organizations' records show his involvement with the National Lawyers
				Guild, both on the national and local levels; material types include
				correspondence, agendas and minutes, working notes, conference and convention
				files, and historical materials. A photo album of the Seattle chapter's 50th
				anniversary is also present. A copy of Caughlan's FBI file is also
				included.</p>

					 <p>This is one of a number of Coast Guard screening cases
						handled by Caughlan. Because it was the first of the group on which the Coast
						Guard took action, many of the related cases did not have their own case files,
						and thus have been kept with the Ranta case. Other clients were Elmer Allen,
						Stokes Chiles, Stephen Connolly, John Edmonson, Nels Ekroth, Meyer Schneider,
						Robert Krahl, Ronald Simpson and Thomas Normann. Separate case files exist for
						Milton Corley and Ronald Simpson (in this accession) and Stokes Chiles (in
						accession 704-001).</p>

			 <p>Prison letters from Caughlan's eight months of incarceration in
				McNeil Island federal penitentiary in 1961 for failing to file tax returns in
				1956 and 1957. Photographs from several civil rights and civil liberties cases
				of clients Caughlan represented, including the 1948 Canwell hearings on alleged
				un-American activity at the Univesity of Washington where Caughlan represented
				Professor Herbert Phillips, who refused to testify. Three UW professors,
				including Phillips, were later fired. Other photos depict Caughlan with members
				of the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America
				(UCAPAWA), who were members of the John Caughlan Defense Committee, formed to
				support Caughlan after he was indicted by a federal grand jury for committing
				perjury after serving three years on the state Social Security Committee. The
				jury allege that Caughlan had lied about his communist beliefs at a government
				proceeding in 1946. He was later acquitted.</p>
