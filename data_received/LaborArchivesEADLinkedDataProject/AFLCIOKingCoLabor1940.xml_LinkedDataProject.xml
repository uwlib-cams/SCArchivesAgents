		<p>The King County Labor Council has long been the communal
		  decision-making body of the various union locals in King County. From the
		  mid-1920s until the reunification of the AFL and CIO in 1955, only
		  AFL-affiliated unions were represented on the Council. At other times, however,
		  the vast majority of King County's locals had a voice on the Council.</p> 
		<p>The Council has passed through at least four distinct periods in its
		  history. The Council originally began in 1888 as the Western Central Labor
		  Union. This body changed its name to the Central Labor Council of Seattle and
		  Vicinity in 1905. These groups occasionally joined coalitions with Populists
		  and other reform groups in local and state politics. Nonetheless, much of the
		  early Council's energy was spent simply trying to survive. The second phase of
		  the Council's history began roughly in 1914 with the labor shortage that
		  allowed unions to organize much of Seattle. The Council grew increasingly
		  radical in this period and became the dominant force in Seattle's powerful
		  progressive coalition. The loss of the Council's power began with the mass
		  layoffs of shipyard workers after World War I. These layoffs led the Council to
		  call the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the only truly city-wide general
		  strike in American history. Employers responded to the failed strike with an
		  open shop drive that de-unionized most of King County. A series of internal
		  power struggles plagued the Council after the strike. The Council voted to
		  expel members of the Industrial Workers of the World in late 1919 and Communist
		  Party members in 1925.</p> 
		<p>The growing conservative influence in the Council was solidified when
		  Dave Beck and his Teamsters came to dominate the group in the late 1920s. The
		  third phase of the Council's history was thus business unionism, Beck-style.
		  Dave Beck began his career as a driver for the Council's cooperative laundry
		  but rapidly rose to become the chief Teamster organizer west of the Rockies.
		  Beck used the strategic position of truck drivers in the economy to start
		  rebuilding the strength of organized labor in Seattle. If the Council declared
		  a firm to be "unfair to labor," he could often prevent the firm from trucking
		  its goods to market. Despite Beck's occasionally ruthless tactics, he believed
		  that businesses had a right to make a profit. When the Great Depression spurred
		  widespread organizing drives, many firms concluded that they would much rather
		  deal with the avowedly anti-radical Beck than with a CIO union. The Council
		  routinely backed Beck in his jurisdictional disputes with CIO and independent
		  unions. Thus, by the end of World War II, Seattle was largely a closed-shop AFL
		  town. Under Beck's reign, the Council stayed fairly aloof from politics,
		  endorsing moderate pro-labor Democrats and spurning the leftist coalitions that
		  fought for local and state offices.</p> 
		<p>The fourth stage of the Council's history, its reentry into local
		  politics, began with the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955. The expanded
		  Council was quickly put on the defensive by statewide right-to-work proposals
		  in Initiative 198 in 1956 and Initiative 202 in 1958. The Council played a
		  leading role in the campaigns that defeated these measures. After these
		  victories, the Council went on the offensive. It started a pro-labor public
		  relations campaign in 1959 that included donating money to charities and
		  promoting radio and television appearances by labor leaders. Beginning in 1964,
		  the Council's Committee on Political Education launched major voter
		  registration drives before elections. The growth of public sector unions in the
		  1950s and 1960s, coupled with the addition of progressive CIO unions, led the
		  Council to endorse expanded social services and public housing in this period.
		  The Council also supported the efforts of Seattle civil rights groups during
		  the 1960s. Nonetheless, the Council retained some traces of business unionism.
		  It gave a no-strike pledge during the 1962 World's Fair and often helped the
		  Chamber of Commerce lobby for subsidies for local businesses.</p> 
		<p>During the latter years of the 20th century, the period documented in
		  Accession 1940-2, the council's executive secretaries were, in succession:
		  James K. Bender, Dan Bickford, Ron Judd, and Steve Williamson.</p> 
		<p>In 2005, the name changed to Martin Luther King County Labor Council,
		  commonly referred to as MLK Labor.</p>

			 <p>Administrative Records primarily document the end of the third and
				the start of the fourth period of the Council's history. The bulk consists of
				the files of Chet W. Ramage, executive secretary of the Council from Oct. 1959
				through 1968. Most correspondence dates from that period. There are virtually
				no letters from before 1950. Incoming letters are sorted and indexed by name of
				author, while outgoing and inter-office letters are organized chronologically.
				The correspondence primarily involved member unions and government officials.
				The subject files—which contain reports, memoranda, and some
				correspondence grouped together by subject—mostly cover topics between
				1946 and 1970. There are, however, small subject files on the 1919 strike, the
				Council's internal power struggles in the early 1920s, and the AFL vs. CIO
				jurisdictional disputes of the 1930s. The accession also contains the complete
				minutes of the Council from 1915 to 1954 and from 1963 to 1970, documenting all
				of the organization's formal resolutions and actions. There is also a copy of
				the minutes of the Council's Executive Board for 1906 to 1907, 1913 to 1957,
				1960 to 1965, and 1969 to 1970. The Executive Board's primary duty was to hear
				union complaints against local businesses and to decide which firms would be
				placed on the "unfair" list. In addition, the Council's membership and tax
				records from 1889 to 1962 are found in this accession.</p> 
			 <p>Records of the Council's committees make up another series.
				Included are committees to defeat the right-to-work initiatives in 1956 and
				1958, the Public Relations Committee from 1959 to 1963, and the Committee on
				Political Education from 1963 to 1968 form another subgroup. </p> 
			 <p>The West Central Labor Union Records series consists of the
				minutes and the financial records of the Council's predecessor, the West
				Central Labor Union, from 1891 to 1905.</p> 
			 <p>The Other Labor Organizations series includes records from the
				United Labor Advisory Committee Against Initiative 202, the Seattle American
				Publishing Company, and others.</p>

			 <p>The Administrative Records series include minutes from 1987-1997
				and financial statements from 1982-1999. There also is Correspondence with
				Affiliated Unions from 1983-2003, including Service Employees, Teamsters, and
				United Food and Commercial Workers. The Subject Series includes information
				about labor related topics as well as correspondence with non-affiliated
				organizations from 1970-2002. The Committee on Political Education series
				includes mailings and subject files on political candidates from 1992-1999.

			 <p>Prior to the transfer of these records, labor historian Ross
				Rieder was hired by the Council to prepare them. He worked with the Special
				Collections Curator of Manuscripts to determine content to be weeded. In
				Affiliate Correspondence, routine correspondence about per capita assessments
				and about delegates was not retained. Within the Committee on Political Action
				subject series, candidate evaluation questionnaires were retained for higher
				level offices, but not for lesser ones.</p>

			 <p>Publications such as King County Labor News, delegate roll call
				ledgers, subject files on various topics, correspondence with affiliates, and
				banners from marches and events. This collection is primarily communications
				between the King County Labor Council and other labor organizations within the
				greater Seattle area. It is separated into five series: publications, delegate
				roll call ledgers, subject files, correspondence with affiliates, and banners
				from marches/events. The date range of the materials is from 1978 to 2011. </p>
			 
			 <p>The publications series is all issues of the quarterly
				organizational publication, King County Labor News, dating from 1987 to
				1995.</p> 
			 <p>The delegate roll call ledgers series is three large ledger books
				containing signatures of KCLC delegates from 1978 to 1991, as well as several
				packets of spreadsheet sign-in ledgers.</p> 
			 <p>The subject files series contains contracts and bargaining
				agreements/negotiations from local unions, organizational resolutions, Seattle
				Union Now materials, and several KCLC campaigns, dating from 1985 to 2006.</p> 
			 <p>The correspondence with affiliates series is communications
				between the KCLC and local unions as well as labor rights campaigns and
				organizations and dates from 1982 to 2011.</p> 
			 <p>The banners from marches/events series is comprised of two canvas
				banners, the first from a KCLC Organizing for Change campaign and the second
				from the Fight for 15 campaign, c. 2014.</p>
