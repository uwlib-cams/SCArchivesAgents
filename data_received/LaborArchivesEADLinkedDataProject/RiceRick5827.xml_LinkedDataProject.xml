		<p>Richard "Rick" Rice was born in 1940 and grew up in Huntington Beach,
		  California. Rice attended the University of California at Berkeley before
		  moving to New York City and then to Seattle in the early 1970s. Rice was active
		  in the student, anti-war, and civil rights movements of the 1960s and
		  1970s.</p> 
		<p>Rice worked as a bus driver for Metro Transit for four years, where he
		  was an active union member and a member of a rank-and-file caucus committe.
		  Rice participated in a Metro Transit strike in 1974. During the 70s and 80s,
		  Rice was an activist in several local organizations such as Committee for
		  Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES), the Venceremos Brigade, and
		  the Anti-Apartheid movement. Rice participated in weekly protests in front of
		  the South African consulate in Seattle during this period.</p> 
		<p>His wife, Roselynn Harrell (also known as Rose Woodward) was also a
		  Seattle metro driver and a social and labor activist. Harrell was involved in
		  South Seattle Community College's Women's Employment Network and was a welder.
		  Rice and Harrell worked for two years at a Uniroyal and Firestone tire plant in
		  Long Beach California in an effort to organize it politically as an outgrowth
		  of their activism as members of the socialist organization Line of March. Line
		  of March was a Marxist-Leninist organization that inspired many New Left
		  student activists to become "proletarianized" workers who would find work in
		  industry and radicalize other workers.</p> 
		<p>During the 1990s, Rice was active in the Seattle area efforts to
		  create a Labor Party and attended conferences on behalf of the effort. Rice's
		  second wife, Kate Thompson is an artist and an activist. Thompson was a
		  co-founder and co-owner of Storefront Press in Seattle. As of 2014, Rice lives
		  in Mexico.</p>
