1776-017,"Evans, Brock, 1937-",Brock Evans papers,"Brock Evans' career as a leader in the environmental movement began in the mid-1960's. He has held prominent positions in numerous environmental organizations. Evans represents the branch of the movement that believes in achieving environmental goals by changing government policy through political give and take, litigation, and legislative lobbying. Â¶ Evans served as the Northwest representative of the Sierra Club and of the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs from 1967 to 1973, as acting director and director of the Washington D.C. office of the Sierra Club from 1973 to 1981, and as vice president for national issues for the National Audubon Society from 1981 to 1996. Evans also was the Audubon representative to the Ancient Forest Alliance circa 1988 to 1994. He also served on the board of a number of other environmental organizations, including the League of Conservation Voters and the Environmental Law Institute and the North Cascades Conservation Council. Most recently he has served as President of the Endangered Species Coalition Â¶ Born in 1937 in Columbus, Ohio, Evans earned his B.A. from Princeton in 1959. He spent two years in the U.S. Marine Corps and then earned his law degree at the University of Michigan while serving in the reserve of the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1963 Evans moved to Seattle and worked in a private law practice until his career changed course in the late 1960's. In 1966 while hiking in one of his favorite areas Evans encountered signs indicating that the ancient trees there were about to be logged. Infuriated by the impending loss of this forest, he left his private law practice and dedicated himself full-time to fighting environmental destruction. Â¶ Within very little time, Evans established himself as one of the leading environmentalists in the Pacific Northwest. From 1967 to 1973 he was the Northwest Representative for the Sierra Club and represented the Audubon Society through the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. As the Sierra Club Representative, he also was a co-founder of the Washington Environmental Council in 1968. During this time He became heavily active in state and regional environmental issues during this time. He organized citizen support and was the primary lobbyist in Washington State during the final crucial years when legislation was being formulated to establish North Cascades National Park. He led efforts to ensure that key parcels were included in the Pasayten and Glacier Peak Wilderness areas. His efforts led to renewed strength for campaigns to gain wilderness protection for the Alpine Lakes and other unprotected regions in the Cascades. In 1972 he received the Environmentalist of the Year award from the Washington Environmental Council. Â¶ In 1973, Evans moved into the national arena when he was named Director of the Sierra Club's Washington, D.C. office. In this position he lobbied Congress as well as administrative agencies, state and local governments, and other organizations on a wide range of environmental issues. Preserving Hell's Canyon was one of the major issues during his time at the Sierra Club. Private and public utility companies had wanted to dam this 100 mile stretch of Idaho's Snake River for over two decades, but had been unable to do so because of disputes about who would build and control the dam. In the 1970's, these energy interests came together and appeared able and willing to cooperate enough to undertake the project, but Evans set a historic precedent by filing the first environmental lawsuit in the Northwest against the dams. Then he, along with other environmentalists, successfully lobbied for federal legislation in 1975 that prevented any dam construction, legislation that Evans drafted himself. Â¶ During his time with the Sierra Club, Evans continued to gain a higher profile and a reputation as an outstanding lobbyist and leader. In 1977, U.S. News and World Report named him one of the most influential lobbyists in Washington, D.C., as did Fortune in 1982, showing not only his own strength, but the lobbying strength and legitimacy that environmentalists had gained. During this time he also served on the Environmental Advisory Board of the Army Corps of Engineers. Â¶ In 1981, Evans became the National Audubon Society's Vice-President for National Issues where he remained until 1996. During his career with the Audubon Society, the preservation of old growth forests in the Pacific Northwest was a major focus for Evans, as it had been throughout his career as an environmental advocate. Evans feared that timber companies were logging old growth forests too quickly and that the nation's ancient forests would soon be gone if nothing were changed. He believed that the ancient forest ecosystem could not be preserved by clear cutting patches of trees, as the Forest Service allowed timber companies to do. Â¶ Many of Evans's efforts to save ancient forests involved lobbying Congress, which had the power to change Forest Service policies and increase or limit logging in specific areas. In the mid 1980's, Evans and the Audubon Society directed much of their lobbying efforts toward Congressional appropriations committees, but met with only limited success. Evans and the Audubon Society then changed their strategy and teamed up with other environmental organizations to form the Ancient Forest Alliance. One of the coalition's new strategies involved focusing on the enforcement of existing laws to preserve forests, and the spotted owl soon became a central component of this strategy. The number of spotted owls was declining significantly because of logging in old growth forests. Environmentalists and biologists believed that the spotted owl was a \""management indicator species\"" and that its fortune was an indicator of the entire group of species in the old growth forests. For people such as Evans, the demise of this animal bolstered their belief in the importance of preserving the ancient forest ecosystem, but the owl's demise also gave them a new opportunity to prevent future logging. Because of the federal Endangered Species Act, which mandated the preservation of ecosystems that supported endangered species, classifying the owl as endangered would prevent logging in areas where they existed. However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was reluctant to list the owl as endangered, which Evans and others alleged was a result of timber industry influence and not because of scientific research. Because of environmentalists' litigious efforts, the federal courts in 1990 forced the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the spotted owl as \""threatened\"" and issued an injunction forbidding further habitatae destruction. These decisions were major victories for environmentalists and ended logging in many areas of ancient forests where spotted owls were believed to live. Â¶ Despite this victory, political battles over ancient forests continued between environmentalists and logging interests. Evans and others tried to press for more protected areas while logging interests tried to portray environmentalists as people who cared more about spotted owls than about loggers and the communities that depended on the timber industry. In 1993, the newly elected president Bill Clinton called a forest summit in Portland, Oregon to try to find compromise between logging interest and environmentalists. As a leader of one of the largest environmental organizations, Evans participated in the summit. Â¶ Another major issue for Evans during his time with the Audubon Society was the preservation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), located along the northern coast of Alaska. In the late 1980's, oil interest believed that there might be huge oil reserves in the Refuge but needed special legislation to open it to drilling. In 1989, a bill to allow drilling in the ANWR was about to pass through Congress when it suddenly was shelved because of the anti-oil backlash after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Nonetheless, legislation to open the refuge continued to surface in the early 1990's, but Evans, along with other environmentalists, was able to block its passage through Congress. After 1992, bills to open the refuge did pass through Congress on more than one occasion, but with President Clinton sure to veto such legislation, Evans and other environmentalists gave the issue less attention. Â¶ Throughout most of his environmental career, Evans took a pragmatic approach to conservation and at times received harsh criticism from those who said he was willing to compromise. This tension was often evident between local grassroots organizations, including chapters of the Audubon Society, and D.C.-based groups such as the Sierra Club and Audubon offices that Evans helped guide. However, on at least on occasion, Evans took a militant stance when he, along with a former U.S. Representative, Jim Jontz, and other environmental activists, was arrested in 1995 for blocking a logging road in Oregon's Siskiyou National Forest. Evans was protesting what was known as the \""Salvage Rider\"" that allowed tree cutting but had passed into law only because it was attached to an important piece of unrelated legislation. Â¶ During his time with the Audubon Society, Evans continued to undertake many activities both related and unrelated to the society's work. In 1984, he ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives from Washington's first congressional district. In the mid 1980's, he helped found and served on the Board of Directors of the Coast Alliance, an organization that tried to influence the government's coastal zone management plans. From 1985 until 1991, Evans was the Washington, D.C. representative of the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, and from 1989 to 1991 was on the Board of Directors of the Boundary Waters Wilderness Foundation. The Foundation raised funds and tried to expand the Boundary Waters Wilderness, as well as outlaw the use of motor vehicles for portaging. Throughout much of the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's, Evans was on the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation voters and chaired its Political Strategy Committee. For the League, Evans helped review and choose political candidates for the group's endorsements. From 1989 to 1994, he was also on the Board of Directors of the Environmental Law Institute, a think tank for members of the American Environmental Bar. Evans also was a board member for RESTORE: The North Woods, a grassroots organization that pushed for forestland protection in the North Woods eco region (a region extending over the northern tier of states from Maine to Minnesota). He also served on the Steering Committee of the Environmental Coalition for North America in the late l980's. Â¶ The overlapping issues of race and the environmental activism surfaced many times during Evans's career. From 1984 to 1991 he was a board member for the Human Environment Center, an organization that tried to bridge the gap between mostly white, middle-class environmentalists, and underprivileged minorities who typically had little involvement in the movement. The Center focused largely on the environmental problems of the cities, especially those that affected mostly poor minority groups, and tried to get minorities more involved in environmental issues. In the early 1990's, the issue of race and environment again took center stage when Evans helped found the Green Wave Movement. The Movement's goal was \""to restore American life and the American continent\"" and creates \""the foundation of a new green society based on the principles of environmental justice and a sustainable economy.\"" However, the group became divided over internal issues, mostly focusing on the homogeneity of its leaders, which critics believed was paradigmatic of the environmental movement as a whole. For Evans, it was a difficult and frustrating experience and he stepped down from the Steering Committee to open a position for someone other than a white male. Â¶ After retiring as Vice-President for the Audubon Society in 1996, Evans remained in Washington, D.C. as a lobbying consultant and in this capacity has continued working for environmental groups. In 1997 Evans became President of the Endangered Species Coalition in Washington, D.C. The Coalition is an association of 450 environmental, scientific, and religious groups dedicated to protecting and strengthening the Endangered Species Act. Â¶ "

0097-004,"Matthews, Mark A. (Mark Allison), 1867-1940",Mark A. Matthews papers,"Mark Matthews was minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Seattle from 1902 until his death in 1940. During that time he had a significant role in Seattle's history. Â¶ Matthews's life reflects many of the currents and tensions that prevailed in America from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of the Second World War. He was deeply aware of the change in America from a rural orientation to an urban and industrialized one. Involved with the progressive movement, he found the implications of the First World War and the radical labor movement in Seattle threatening. In this context Matthews fought to make the Church a moving force within society and preserve his concept of religious orthodoxy. This led him to become a proponent of fundamentalism and an opponent of modernism within the Presbyterian church. Â¶ Born in Calhoun, Georgia, on September 24, 1867, Matthews received his formal education at the town's local academy. He was ordained there in 1887, and after brief ministries in Calhoun and Dalton, Georgia, he accepted a ministry in Jackson, Tennessee. Clearly part of the social gospel movement, Matthews attempted to adapt the church to urban conditions. During his years in Jackson, 1896-1901, he was instrumental in building a hospital, organizing a night school, and founding a local humane society. His work as an organizer and preacher earned him an honorary doctorate from Tennessee Normal University and soon after, a call to become minister to Seattle's First Presbyterian Church. Â¶ Matthews viewed himself as a progressive with the dual mission of expanding his church and rooting out the corruption prevalent in Seattle at that time. Membership in his congregation grew to ten thousand, the largest Presbyterian church in the world. At the same time, he waged active campaigns against Seattle mayors, police chiefs, business leaders, saloon keepers, and others whom he perceived as evil. Â¶ By 1912 Matthews had been elected moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. This led to a close association with Woodrow Wilson, and Matthews became a frequent guest at the White House. As Wilson's devoted follower, Matthews began to consider opponents of Wilson as well as Seattle's radical labor leaders in the International Woodworkers of the World grave threats to the security of the nation. Consequently he became increasingly conservative, calling for restriction of immigration and repressive measures in the context of the red scare of the 1920s, and increasingly strident in his support for such issues as Prohibition, fundamentalism, and William Jennings Bryan's crusade against the teaching of evolution. Strongly opinionated, Matthews made many enemies, but he also had thousands of devoted followers. While his theology was relatively simple, his life reveals the complexity of forces working in America as this Southerner in the Pacific Northwest attempted to lead Seattle to his own particular vision of righteousness.Â¶ "
1920-009,Pacific Northwest Library Association,Pacific Northwest Library Association records,"The Pacific Northwest Library Association (PNLA) was founded in 1909 during a three day conference at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle. The original members included librarians from Washington and Oregon, as well as the Provincial Librarian of British Columbia, but the membership grew to include librarians from Idaho, Montana and Utah. The PNLA affiliated with the American Library Association (ALA) in 1914. Among the achievements of the PNLA was the creation of the Subscription Books Bulletin in 1917, which eventually merged with another publication to become the ALA's Booklist. Although experiencing restructuring through the years, the PNLA celebrated its centennial in 2009 and remains the only regional library association to incorporate an international border. Â¶ "
1930-010,Young Women's Christian Association (University of Washington),Young Women's Christian Association (University of Washington) interviews,"The University of Washington Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) was established in 1895 by Ella Chamberlain, head of the English department. It was the first women's organization on campus and was organized before the incorporation of the national YWCA in 1906. In its early years, the UW YWCA was mostly a religious organization, offering Bible study groups, and devotional and missionary meetings. Throughout the 1910s, members volunteered to perform mission work and teach English to Japanese immigrants in local settlement houses. In 1916 the tenth anniversary of the national YWCA's founding was celebrated through the national jubilee. Â¶ In 1930 after the State Legislature prohibited religious organizations from being housed on the University campus, the UW YWCA moved off campus. In 1940 it merged with the UW YMCA and the two organizations operated jointly for the next thirty years . The UW YMCA-YWCA were housed in Eagleson Hall from 1940 to 1964. Eagleson Hall was sold to the University of Washington in 1964, and a new, spacious building was completed in 1965 at 4525 19th Ave. N.E. Â¶ In 1962 UW denied a campus group space for a talk by Gus Hall, general secretary of the American Communist Party. Students petitioned the UW YMCA-YWCA for rental use of Eagleson Hall, which was granted after much debate. The decision to allow a Communist speaker use YMCA-YWCA resources sparked immediate outrage and support. Members of the general public, students, faculty, and other YMCA-YWCA executives voiced their opinions through phone calls, letters, and newspaper articles. Some believed in the upholding of freedom of speech ; others were outraged by the \""unAmerican\"" and \""un-Christian\"" nature of the Communist Party. The topic of Hall's speech was the McCarran Internal Security Act (1950), which required registration of Communist party members and attempted to criminalize the party. Elizabeth Jackson and Frank Mark, respective executive directors for the UW YMCA-YWCA, made the difficult decision to allow Hall a speaking platform. (Elizabeth Jackson later went on to head the Western Region of the National Student YWCA.) After the controversial event, the organizations drafted an open platform policy, affirming their commitment to freedom of speech and intellectual pursuit. Throughout the 1960s, speakers and forums were sponsored by the UW YMCA-YWCA on diverse topics such as LSD use, the beatnik or \""fringie\"" problem on University Way, capital punishment, racism, and birth control. Â¶ 1970 was a pivotal year for the UW YWCA, marking its declaration of autonomy from the YMCA and subsequent move to 4224 University Way N.E. The effects of the second wave of the women's movement can be seen in its motivation for independent status, namely its commitment to \""the development of a separate, visible identity of self-determining women-not identical to, but equal to men.\"" Over the course of a decade, the UW YWCA pioneered feminist programming, providing an extensive range of services and activities not only for UW students but also for women throughout the Seattle area. Many of the UW YWCA's programs were considered radical or controversial , and pushed the understanding of what a YWCA meant for women and a community. Â¶ The Abortion Birth Control (ABC) Referral Service was formed after a UW student group, the Committee for Abortion Reform , was ordered off campus for advocating passage of a 1970 abortion reform bill (Referendum 20) in Washington State. ABC found a home at the UW YWCA, disbanding as a politically-focused group and reforming as a support service. The ABC Referral Service provided doctor referrals, counseling and advocacy to women considering abortion procedures, as well as birth control methods, and a range of other reproductive health topics. ABC staff regularly visited the offices of doctors providing abortions and gathered information from abortion patients about their experiences to ensure the quality of their referrals. Â¶ Another UW YWCA program centered on women's health. Aradia Clinic opened in 1972 after a year of organizing. The clinic was built by over sixty women under the leadership of a female architect. Aradia strongly encouraged patients to take their health into their own hands. Aradia staff offered annual examinations, pregnancy detection and counselling , and other medical services, as well as self-health classes, workshops, and abortion procedures. In 1973, Aradia sponsored the Third World Women Family Planning Needs Assessment Project. Several community groups, including EI Centro de la Raza and Planned Parenthood, encouraged Aradia to research the need for family planning services within Seattle's ethnic communities. The project's objective was to determine what family planning services were needed and how those needs could be met. Information was gathered from family planning clinics, ethnic service centers, and a sampling of women from each community. The report was completed in 1974 and included extensive demographic material and a list of recommendations. In 1973, Aradia legally separated from the YWCA in order to release the Board of Directors from responsibility for Aradia's actions, although it continued to be housed in the UW YWCA building until 1978. As of 2005, it operates as the Aradia Women's Health Center, and has remained committed to providing feminist health care for women. Â¶ The Lesbian Resource Center began as the Gay Women's Resource Center in 1971 after a UW YWCA staff member took a course on homosexuality at the UW Experimental College and recognized a need in the community. The LRC was a peer counseling center that prpvidea support services to lesbians in the Seattle-King County area. As well as providing individual counseling , a lending library, and a speaker's bureau, discussion \""rap\"" groups were offered. The LRC also worked to make changes within the UW YWCA, pushing for more lesbian membership on the Board of Directors. The LRC became independent from the UW YWCA in 1980. It gained non-profit status under the name Pacific Women's Resources but continued to offer services as the LRC. As of 2005, the LRC is still active in Seattle. Â¶ Mechanica began as a women's co-operative garage and auto mechanics course in 1972. By 1975, it had evolved into a skilled trades information service for women seeking to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades and other nontraditional jobs. As well as providing job counseling , Mechanica staff promoted affirmative action hiring of women and ethnic minorities and pushed for affirmative action placements in union apprenticeships. They worked hard to persuade the University of Washington to adopt a 12% goal for women on UW construction sites. Off campus, Mechanica worked as a consultant to the City of Seattle and King County to help them reach affirmative action goals. It also worked with Federal Contract Compliance officers to push local private companies to hire women. Mechanica lost funding in1980, and the program was converted into a Women's Employment Service. Â¶ Women in Trades (WIT) emerged out of Mechanica as an advocacy group for equal employment opportunites for women and people of color in the trades. In operation by 1976, WIT was an organization of working women employed in bluecollar jobs in the production, maintenance, and construction industries. They were dedicated to establishing legal action for the enforcement of affirmative action goals on a local and national level. Together with Mechanica, WIT negotiated with the Port of Seattle and local unions to ensure they met affirmative action hiring guidelines. WIT also offered support groups and legal support for tradeswomen . WIT was defunct by 1979, but the annual Women in Trades Fair started by Mechanica in 1979 still continues. Â¶ Rape Relief was formed in 1972 following a speakout on rape on the UW campus. Rape Relief provided a 24-hour crisis line for victims of sexual assault and their allies, as well as medical and legal advocacy . Rape Relief staff promoted community education about rape by speaking to junior high and high school students, as well as to various adult community groups. Projects designed for developmentally disabled people, ethnic communities and non-English speaking victims were created. Rape Relief also conducted sensitivity training for police in Washington, Oregon and Alaska . Rape Relief became independent in 1980 and continued to operate as Seattle Rape Relief until financial problems forced its closure in 1999. Â¶ Serve Our Sisters (SOS) was formed in 1970 by two Seattle feminists and was modeled on a temporary, feminist, emergency housing service for women in crisis in New York City. In 1972, SOS became part of the UW YWCA, obtaining a much-needed central telephone. SOS provided women with housing, referrals, a telephone crisis line, and emotional support. Local referral agencies, such as the Open Door Clinic and Harborview Emergency Room, also used SOS's services. By 1974, SOS was no longer an active. Â¶ The Third World Women's Resource Center opened in the summer of 1973 as part of the UW YWCA's attempt to implement the One Imperative to Eliminate Racism. The One Imperative was a National YWCA policy which pushed for \""the elimination of racism wherever it exists and by any means necessary.\"" One of the main purposes of the Center was to provide educational material for all women struggling with the intersections of racism, sexism and economic oppression. The Center was developed and coordinated by Third World women, or women of color. Counseling, classes, rap groups, a library, a speaker's bureau, and a referral service were offered, and there were also efforts to interact with incarcerated women of color. The Center was no longer active by 1976. The failure of the UW YWCA to implement the One Imperative successfully caused tension among staff and Board members. Â¶ Women in Midstream (WI M) was started as the Ad-Hoc Committee on Menopause in 1972 by several middle-aged women who served on the Board of Directors and saw the need for a program dedicated to older women's health, particularly on the topic of menopause. WIM sent out questionnaires about women's personal experiences dealing with symptoms, treatments and the medical field. Due to a small amount of unexpected national publicity, women from around the United States participated and looked to WIM as a resource on menopause. A WIM volunteer, Jane Page wrote a book The Other Awkward Age utilizing the questionnaire results and contributing a much-needed woman's perspective on menopause. WIM was no longer in operation by 1979. Â¶ Women's Divorce Cooperative (WDC) began operating in 1971 as a cooperative of women interested in learning more about divorce law and how to file for divorce without hiring a lawyer. The WDC became an official UW YWCA program in 1975. In its early years, WDC volunteers provided sessions in pro se divorce procedures, as well as referrals to lawyers, counselors, and other agencies for further help in securing a divorce. Telephone and in-person counseling were also available to help women cope emotionally with a divorce. The WDC separated from the UW YWCA in 1980 to regain financial control and restore a cooperative philosophy. Â¶ The feminist spirit inherent in the UW YWCA's programming can also be seen in internal organizational changes. In the two years following its independence from the UW YMCA, the staff structure shifted from a hierarchical to a co-director model, in which three adminstrators received equal pay. The Co-Directorship was seen as a more egalitarian power structure. Evaluation of the model began in 1975, and in 1976, the Board of Directors voted to return to an Executive Coordinator model. The Executive Coordinator was responsible for agency supervision, staff development and supervision , fiscal management, liasion with the Board, and coordination with the community services. Many staff members were displeased with the restructuring; some did not feel included in the decision-making process and others did not believe the model fit into a feminist organiza tion. Â¶ In 1980, the UW YWCA was evicted from University Way and moved away from the UW campus to Northlake. They remained at 701 NE Northlake Way until 1988 and continued to \""struggle for peace and justice, freedom and dignity for all people ,\"" as stated by the National YWCA purpose. The UW YWCA was still active in 1995 on the UW campus, though they may have become defunct as early as 1996. Â¶ "

The number of standing committees grew with the increasing membership and interests of the club. Mountain climbing has been one of the major interests. In 1935 climbing classes were organized to teach the fundamentals of Mountaineering. The Mountaineers were the first organized group to develop skiing in the Northwest. Newman, of Evanston, Illinois, visited Seattle in the summer of 1911 and participated in the Mountaineers' Fifth Annual Outing (a walking tour along the Cascade Crest, and a steamboat ride down the Columbia to Vancouver.)"

0001-005,Port Blakely Mill Company,Port Blakely Mill Company records,"Lumber mill.Â¶ At its height, the Port Blakely Mill Company was the largest on the Pacific Coast, and possibly in the entire world. Captain William Renton founded it in 1863 on Bainbridge Island, directly across from Seattle in the Puget Sound. Within a year the mill was turning out 50,000 board feet a day. The PBMCo expanded rapidly, as did the timber industry in Washington territory generally. (In the 1880s, the territory's annual timber production soared from 160 million board feet to over a billion). Although the California market was the most crucial, the PBMCo shipped its lumber throughout the Pacific Rim. The PBMCo briefly tried to enter the European market, but the long voyage around South America posed too great of a logistical challenge for consistent shipments to Europe. Â¶ In 1876, Renton incorporated the company in San Francisco with new partner Charles S. Holmes. Prior to 1885, the PBMCo obtained all its logs by contract with independent operators, since Renton did not want to take on either the additional risk or capital investment of logging camps. The decreasing supply of accessible high-quality lumber and the steady inflation in log prices led him to change his policy. He noted in 1864 that timber \""contiguous to the Sound is nearly exhausted.\"" The company purchased land north of Olympia, and constructed the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor Railroad to transport the logs. By 1891, the company held 80,000 acres of timber land. A fire destroyed the mill in 1888, but a new one, larger and more efficient, was in operation within the year. Â¶ The PBMCo would face other stiff challenges in the 1890s, and would do so without the guidance of Renton, who died in 1891. A devastating depression swept the United States in 1893, forcing the company to operate in a hostile economic climate. It also faced increased competition from eastern mills moving into the Pacific Northwest. The St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company managed to rival PBMCo's position as the largest mill in the region during the 1890s. Weyerhaeuser entered the region in 1900, purchasing 900,000 acres of timberland. The PBMCo became increasingly ill-suited for competition with firms better located for participation in the rail and cargo trades. Â¶ In February 1903 Renton's heirs sold the company to two men from Michigan, David E. Skinner and John W. Eddy. The mill burned again in 1907, and the one built to replace it was much smaller. By 1912, the new mill operated only sporadically. Demands generated by the First World War temporarily returned the mill's economic viability; after the war, the demand crashed, and so did the mill's brief economic resurgence. Eddy and Skinner closed it in 1922 and divided the PBMCo's assets. The defunct mill was dismantled in 1924. Eddy bought out Skinner in that same year, and from that point forward the PBMCo relied upon its timber holdings and was exclusively an Eddy family concern. Â¶ "

1732-010,North Cascades Conservation Council,North Cascades Conservation Council records,"The North Cascades Conservation Council (NCCC) was organized in 1957 with the mission \""to protect and preserve the North Cascades' scenic, scientific, recreational, educational, and wilderness values.\"" For the next ten years, NCCC was dedicated to its main goal, the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. It was aided by other organizations dedicated to conservation, such as the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. Â¶ Conservation efforts targeting the North Cascades did not begin with NCCC. Concerns about the area were voiced as early as 1892, when a park proposal for Lake Chelan was presented but denounced as being against public interests. In 1937, the first formal proposal for a North Cascades National Park was submitted by the U.S. National Park Service and Owen A. Tomlinson. The proposal was impeded by opposition from the U.S. Forest Service, which had recently lost the battle over the formation of Olympic National Park. Â¶ In the mid-1950s, Grant McConnell, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focused on public land policy, raised the call for an organization to protect the North Cascades. Disturbed by the U.S. Forest Service's plans for timber sales, mining, and construction of a cross-mountain highway over Cascade Pass, McConnell convinced Polly Dyer to call a meeting at her home to discuss the threats to the North Cascades wilderness. McConnell's main objective was the formation of a single-issue conservation group dedicated to the North Cascades. Meeting attendees resisted McConnell's plan, citing the work being done on the issue by the Mountaineers Conservation Division, to which many attendees belonged. The Mountaineers Glacier Peak Subcommitee, chaired by Philip Zalesky, was also praised for its concentration on an important geographic area of the North Cascades. After the meeting, McConnell and other Sierra Club members worked to persuade North Cascades conservation leaders to form an organization. Patrick Goldsworthy was one of those leaders, and he later became the long-time president of NCCC. Â¶ Goldsworthy had proven himself to be a committed Northwest conservationist in the early 1950s. After moving to Seattle in 1952 to accept a research appointment in the University of Washington School of Medicine, he joined the Mountaineers Conservation Division and met John and Polly Dyer. Goldsworthy, together with his wife, Jane, and the Dyers, established the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club in 1954. Â¶ On March 23, 1957, during a Glacier Peak conference in Portland, Oregon, Goldsworthy and others took up the call to protect the North Cascades. Twenty-six people from Washington, Oregon, and California were present for the formation of the North Cascades Conservation Council. NCCC designated its immediate goal as the formation of the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area. Bylaws were written and officers were elected. Philip Zalesky served as president, Pat Goldsworthy as first vice-president, Una Davies as second vice-president, Polly Dyer as secretary, and Yvonne Prater as treasurer. Harvey Manning later joined the group as editor of the NCCC's newsletter. Â¶ With Patrick Goldsworthy serving as leader of both NCCC and the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club, assistance from the national Sierra Club and its executive director, David Brower, was quickly forthcoming. The Sierra Club had begun leading its first outing trips into the North Cascades a year earlier. In 1957, the Sierra Club produced the film, The Wilderness Alps of Stehekin. Publicizing the cause of the North Cascades, the film was shown extensively by the NCCC and other conservation groups. It was also circulated to public officials and members of Congress. Â¶ The Sierra Club furthered its commitment to the Pacific Northwest in 1961 by hiring Michael McCloskey, the first Northwest Conservation representative. The representative was funded by the Federation of the Western Outdoor Clubs and served as a valuable lobbyist and advocate for the formation of national parks and wilderness areas in the Northwest. Â¶ By 1959, support for a North Cascades National Park was strong among conservation organizations, including the NCCC, the National Parks Association, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Cascadians. Conservationists called for the U.S. Forest Service to suspend its plans for timber sales and road construction, and to allow the U.S. National Park Service to conduct a study of the possible park area. Washington Congressman Thomas Pelly, a vocal advocate of conservation, asked the U.S. National Park Service to conduct the study, only to be reprimanded by the director of the U.S. Forest Service for neglecting to ask for permission. Congressman Pelly, with the assistance of the Interior Department and groups such as the NCCC, then attempted to introduce legislation to order the study, but was unsuccessful. Â¶ In 1961, Pelly was presented with a petition bearing 22,000 signatures in favor of a park study. That same year, Washington Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson also joined the debate when they encouraged Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman to develop a forest management plan for the contested areas. Freeman imposed a temporary moratorium on logging, which ended the following year, only to be asked by Pelly to impose a stricter moratorium on logging until a national park study was held. Freeman denied the request, since the U.S. Forest Service had completed a high mountain management policy for the North Cascades. Â¶ In 1963, after disputes between the U.S. Park and Forest Services were settled, a joint study of the North Cascades was announced. The study was recommended by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, and the study team was chaired by the director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Edward C. Crafts. Public hearings to introduce the study were held in Seattle, Wenatchee, and Mount Vernon. The NCCC worked diligently to ensure a majority of oral and written statements in support of park establishment. The NCCC also submitted a comprehensive 120-page plan for the park, entitled Prospectus for a North Cascades National Park. The Prospectus confirmed the NCCC's leadership in the park campaign. Â¶ The study team's report, The North Cascades, was published in October 1965, recommending the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. The Sierra Club published the influential book, The Wild Cascades: Forgotten Parkland, in 1965 as well, to draw further attention to the area. Public hearings were held in 1966 to discuss the study team's findings. On March 20, 1967, Senators Jackson and Magnuson introduced Senate Bill 1321, which established the North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The bill was passed in November, and the following year, in October 1968, the North Cascades National Park Service Complex was created by an act of Congress. Â¶ Another long struggle to which the NCCC was committed was passing the Wilderness Act. The legislative effort began in 1956 as a wilderness bill drafted by Howard Zahniser, director of the Wilderness Society. The bill called for the conservation of the nation's remaining wilderness. Despite initial opposition and numerous revisions, the Wilderness Act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. The act created the National Wilderness Preservation System and put 9.1 million acres of national forest land into the new system. It was the first wilderness protection legislation passed in the world. Â¶ The first major crisis to occur under the Wilderness Act began in 1967 with Kennecott Copper Corporation's plan to create an open-pit mine in Miners Ridge, a location inside the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area and close to Image Lake. Since Kennecott owned the mineral rights to the land, the Wilderness Act's clause regarding private ownership seemed to protect the mine's development. Under pressure from tremendous publicity and opposition by the NCCC and Washington congressmen, Kennecott decided to postpone its plans, although talk of commencing mining operations resumed in 1969 when copper prices soared. The land was later bought from Kennecott and the area protected from commercial interests. Â¶ The NCCC also participated in the debate over roadways in national parks. The Park Service program launched Mission 66 in 1956 to improve deteriorating and dangerous conditions in the national parks that largely resulted from a massive boom in visitors after World War II. Mission 66 expanded visitor capacity in the national parks to accommodate an estimated eighty million automobile tourists within ten years. The program called for adding more overnight accommodations, building visitor centers, and constructing park roads. The roadway debate continued in 1957, when the Washington State legislature authorized a survey for a cross-Cascades highway. On September 2, 1972, the highway, known as the North Cascades Highway, officially opened, to the dismay of NCCC members. Another debate began in 1961 regarding the Outdoor Advertising Act, which established billboard control along scenic highways. The NCCC called for more aggressive controls and restrictions of outdoor advertising than the controversial act established in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the Northwest. Â¶ Over the past third of a century, the NCCC has accomplished much in conservation, including the creation of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Glacier Peak Wilderness, William O. Douglas Wilderness (Cougar Lakes Wilderness Area), Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Mt. Baker Wilderness, Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, and others. The NCCC has also collaborated with British Columbia allies to block the raising of Ross Dam and to encourage the establishment of a U.S.-Canadian international park. In addition, the NCCC newsletter, The Wild Cascades, has kept its members and other conservationists informed of and dedicated to the various issues affecting the North Cascades. The North Cascades Conservation Council has been a leader in the protection and preservation of the North Cascades mountain range from the Columbia River to the U.S.-Canadian border. Â¶ "

0035-001,"Reed, Mark E. (Mark Edward), 1866-1933",Mark E. Reed papers,"Lumberman, financier, politician, and Washington state representative. Â¶ Mark Reed, president of the Simpson Logging Company and speaker of the state House of Representatives, stood at the center of Washington politics throughout the 1920s. Many contemporary observers agreed that Reed could have been elected governor if he had so desired, but business came before politics for Reed: he repeatedly decided that his company would suffer too much if he had to devote most of his time to a governor's duties. Â¶ Born in Olympia in 1866, Reed did not find financial success until 1897 when Sol Simpson hired him to manage the Simpson Logging Company's store in the town of Shelton. After several promotions, he married the boss's daughter, Irene, in 1901. Reed took over the management of the company upon Sol Simpson death in 1906. Simpson Logging was already the biggest company in Shelton, and as Reed expanded the firm, Shelton grew with it. Reed strove to build a firm that could weather the storms of the notoriously turbulent timber industry. While he resisted the unionization of his labor force, he sought to reduce turnover by continually improving living conditions in his logging camps. Â¶ Reed also built two mills in Shelton which brought a degree of vertical integration and allowed the firm to make pulp and other products out of wood that had previously been wasted. These strategies, coupled with Reed's refusal to take on large amounts of debt, allowed Simpson Logging to grow during the 1920s and to survive the Great Depression. Reed also sought to promote cooperation among timber companies and to create stability in lumber markets. As a member of the Spruce Production Board during the First World War, Reed tried to persuade fellow lumbermen to adopt the eight-hour day to undercut the appeal of the Industrial Workers of the World. Reed was later influential in convincing Colonel Bryce Disque, head of the Army's Spruce Production Division, to compel recalcitrant firms to accept the eight-hour day. In the mid- to late-1920s Reed was a key player in the West Coast Lumbermen's Association's failed attempts to get logging companies to drive up prices by limiting their output. Reed directed the unsuccessful fight to raise the tariff on Canadian logs and lumber in 1929. He also participated in the negotiations of the National Recovery Administration's lumber code shortly before his death in 1933. Â¶ Reed brought the same pragmatism and bargaining skills to his political career. After serving as mayor of Shelton for four years, Reed won a seat in the state House of Representatives as a Republican in 1914. Although he strongly favored reducing taxes and opposed most Progressive era reforms, Reed was willing to compromise with reformers and organized labor. His ability to negotiate legislative deals led to his rapid promotion to positions of leadership. He was elected Speaker of the House every legislative session between 1923 and 1929. The biggest fight of Reed's career came when fellow Republican Roland Hartley was inaugurated governor in 1925. Hartley tried to increase the governor's control over administrative agencies and to slash spending on education, roads, and reclamation. When Reed killed the governor's bills, Washington Republicans split into Reed and Hartley factions. Although he narrowly mustered the votes necessary to pass several bills over Hartley's vetoes in 1925, Reed did not want to perpetuate the split in the party. In 1927 and 1929 Reed helped craft compromises between pro- and anti-Hartley forces, most of which enhanced Hartley's power. With his business hit by the Depression and with Hartley clearly replacing him as the dominant player in the Washington Republican Party, Reed decided not to seek re-election in 1930. He did not, however, drop out of politics altogether. Reed agreed to manage President Hoover's re-election campaign in Washington state in 1932, just as he had managed Calvin Coolidge's campaign in 1924 and Hoover's in 1928. Â¶ "

0048-003,"Suzzallo, Henry, 1875-1933",Henry Suzzallo papers,"Henry Suzzallo was president of the University of Washington from 1915 to 1926; president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching from 1913 to 1933; arbitrator of the National War Labor Policies Board; and chairman of the Washington State Council of Defence from 1917 to1918. He also worked toward the adoption of better living and working conditions for loggers in the lumber industry. He died in 1933. Â¶ Glenn Hughes, who founded the University of Washington (UW) Dramatic Art Department under Henry Suzzallo, described him as \""a brilliant man, small and dynamic--the Napoleon of higher education.\"" The characterization was apt; Suzzallo's career was marked by both tremendous achievement and bitter controversies. He was born in 1875 to Croatian immigrants. Following a sickly childhood, Suzzallo began college at the State Normal School in his home town of San Jose, California, lacking both the money and the grades to attend his first choice, Stanford. After two years he graduated, taking a teaching job in a two-room school in Alviso, California. His degree from the Normal School and money from teaching removed the academic and financial barriers, allowing him to attend Stanford. For the next eighteen years, Suzzallo would shuffle between Stanford and Columbia, first pursuing his education, and later as a faculty member at both institutions. During this time, he managed to win himself an increasingly prestigious reputation. When the UW began searching for a new president in 1914, Suzzallo's name was on the short list of candidates. Â¶ In 1914, the UW was a small frontier college undergoing the first growing pains of becoming a major university. It claimed an enrollment of more than 3,000 students, small by the standards of the major American universities of the time, but still a tremendous increase over previous years. It also suffered from a less-than-robust budget. James R. Angell, the Regents' first choice for president, declined the job, primarily because he considered the UW underfunded. Suzzallo was the Regents' second choice, and he accepted the challenge. Even though money never flowed freely, he did prove remarkably adept at squeezing funding from both private donors and the Legislature. Plans for a magnificent new library, patterned after a medieval cathedral, symbolized his success in expanding the size of the campus and the prestige of the university. (The library would eventually bear his name). During this time, enrollment had burgeoned to over 10,000. Suzzallo further augmented his stature in the state during World War I, when he was president of the Washington Council of Defense, which had primary responsibility for the state's war effort. The \""Napoleon of higher education\"" was not to be spared his Waterloo, however. Â¶ The 1924 election of governor Roland Hartley would shatter the relative calm of Suzzallo's presidency. Hartley won on a platform promising government retrenchment and lower taxes. He also had a record of long-standing antagonism towards the UW, which he saw as a hotbed of socialism. \""Education is a fine thing,\"" he acknowledged, \""but that is not all there is to the game of life.\"" The year of the election, Suzzallo had published his book Our Faith in Education, written primarily to present the case for higher education against those who wanted to limit it in favor of tax reduction. Not surprisingly, Hartley's parsimony quickly conflicted with Suzzallo's educational vision. Suzzallo's high salary--$18,000 a year, larger than any other state official--made him and the University especially vulnerable to attack. Not only did Hartley want to curtail university expenditures, he also proposed overhauling the funding and administration system for the state's colleges and universities. Suzzallo did nothing to hide his strong objections to the governor's agenda. The battle spread to the Legislature and the Board of Regents, both Suzzallo allies. Each camp insisted adamantly, if implausibly, that it represented a political virtue intent on rescuing higher education from the political machinations of its opponents. Â¶ Hartley overcame the obstacle of the recalcitrant Regents by removing members supportive of Suzzallo. The Board, now dominated by Hartley's new appointees, put Suzzallo on indefinite leave-of-absence when he refused to resign. Suzzallo's ouster created a political firestorm, although a petition drive for a gubernatorial recall election, despite early momentum, sputtered, and failed to collect the required number of signatures. Suzzallo was flooded immediately with job offers. He decided to accept election as chairman of the board of the Carnegie Foundation. He remained affiliated with the Carnegie Foundation until complications following a heart attack in Seattle claimed his life on September 25, 1933. Â¶ "

Concerns about the area were voiced as early as 1892, when a park proposal for Lake Chelan was presented but denounced as being against public interests. In 1937, the first formal proposal for a North Cascades National Park was submitted by the U.S. National Park Service and Owen A. Tomlinson. The proposal was impeded by opposition from the U.S. Forest Service, which had recently lost the battle over the formation of Olympic National Park. Â¶ In the mid-1950s, Grant McConnell, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focused on public land policy, raised the call for an organization to protect the North Cascades. Disturbed by the U.S. Forest Service's plans for timber sales, mining, and construction of a cross-mountain highway over Cascade Pass, McConnell convinced Polly Dyer to call a meeting at her home to discuss the threats to the North Cascades wilderness. McConnell's main objective was the formation of a single-issue conservation group dedicated to the North Cascades. Meeting attendees resisted McConnell's plan, citing the work being done on the issue by the Mountaineers Conservation Division, to which many attendees belonged. The Mountaineers Glacier Peak Subcommitee, chaired by Philip Zalesky, was also praised for its concentration on an important geographic area of the North Cascades. After the meeting, McConnell and other Sierra Club members worked to persuade North Cascades conservation leaders to form an organization. Patrick Goldsworthy was one of those leaders, and he later became the long-time president of NCCC. Â¶ Goldsworthy had proven himself to be a committed Northwest conservationist in the early 1950s. After moving to Seattle in 1952 to accept a research appointment in the University of Washington School of Medicine, he joined the Mountaineers Conservation Division and met John and Polly Dyer. Goldsworthy, together with his wife, Jane, and the Dyers, established the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club in 1954. Â¶ On March 23, 1957, during a Glacier Peak conference in Portland, Oregon, Goldsworthy and others took up the call to protect the North Cascades. Twenty-six people from Washington, Oregon, and California were present for the formation of the North Cascades Conservation Council. NCCC designated its immediate goal as the formation of the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area. Bylaws were written and officers were elected. Philip Zalesky served as president, Pat Goldsworthy as first vice-president, Una Davies as second vice-president, Polly Dyer as secretary, and Yvonne Prater as treasurer. Harvey Manning later joined the group as editor of the NCCC's newsletter. Â¶ With Patrick Goldsworthy serving as leader of both NCCC and the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club, assistance from the national Sierra Club and its executive director, David Brower, was quickly forthcoming. The Sierra Club had begun leading its first outing trips into the North Cascades a year earlier. In 1957, the Sierra Club produced the film, The Wilderness Alps of Stehekin. Publicizing the cause of the North Cascades, the film was shown extensively by the NCCC and other conservation groups. It was also circulated to public officials and members of Congress. Â¶ The Sierra Club furthered its commitment to the Pacific Northwest in 1961 by hiring Michael McCloskey, the first Northwest Conservation representative. The representative was funded by the Federation of the Western Outdoor Clubs and served as a valuable lobbyist and advocate for the formation of national parks and wilderness areas in the Northwest. Â¶ By 1959, support for a North Cascades National Park was strong among conservation organizations, including the NCCC, the National Parks Association, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Cascadians. Conservationists called for the U.S. Forest Service to suspend its plans for timber sales and road construction, and to allow the U.S. National Park Service to conduct a study of the possible park area. Washington Congressman Thomas Pelly, a vocal advocate of conservation, asked the U.S. National Park Service to conduct the study, only to be reprimanded by the director of the U.S. Forest Service for neglecting to ask for permission. Congressman Pelly, with the assistance of the Interior Department and groups such as the NCCC, then attempted to introduce legislation to order the study, but was unsuccessful. Â¶ In 1961, Pelly was presented with a petition bearing 22,000 signatures in favor of a park study. That same year, Washington Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson also joined the debate when they encouraged Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman to develop a forest management plan for the contested areas. Freeman imposed a temporary moratorium on logging, which ended the following year, only to be asked by Pelly to impose a stricter moratorium on logging until a national park study was held. Freeman denied the request, since the U.S. Forest Service had completed a high mountain management policy for the North Cascades. Â¶ In 1963, after disputes between the U.S. Park and Forest Services were settled, a joint study of the North Cascades was announced. The study was recommended by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, and the study team was chaired by the director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Edward C. Crafts. Public hearings to introduce the study were held in Seattle, Wenatchee, and Mount Vernon. The NCCC worked diligently to ensure a majority of oral and written statements in support of park establishment. The NCCC also submitted a comprehensive 120-page plan for the park, entitled Prospectus for a North Cascades National Park. The Prospectus confirmed the NCCC's leadership in the park campaign. Â¶ The study team's report, The North Cascades, was published in October 1965, recommending the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. The Sierra Club published the influential book, The Wild Cascades: Forgotten Parkland, in 1965 as well, to draw further attention to the area. Public hearings were held in 1966 to discuss the study team's findings. On March 20, 1967, Senators Jackson and Magnuson introduced Senate Bill 1321, which established the North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The bill was passed in November, and the following year, in October 1968, the North Cascades National Park Service Complex was created by an act of Congress. Â¶ Another long struggle to which the NCCC was committed was passing the Wilderness Act. The legislative effort began in 1956 as a wilderness bill drafted by Howard Zahniser, director of the Wilderness Society. The bill called for the conservation of the nation's remaining wilderness. Despite initial opposition and numerous revisions, the Wilderness Act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. The act created the National Wilderness Preservation System and put 9.1 million acres of national forest land into the new system. It was the first wilderness protection legislation passed in the world. Â¶ The first major crisis to occur under the Wilderness Act began in 1967 with Kennecott Copper Corporation's plan to create an open-pit mine in Miners Ridge, a location inside the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area and close to Image Lake. Since Kennecott owned the mineral rights to the land, the Wilderness Act's clause regarding private ownership seemed to protect the mine's development. Under pressure from tremendous publicity and opposition by the NCCC and Washington congressmen, Kennecott decided to postpone its plans, although talk of commencing mining operations resumed in 1969 when copper prices soared. The land was later bought from Kennecott and the area protected from commercial interests. Â¶ The NCCC also participated in the debate over roadways in national parks. The Park Service program launched Mission 66 in 1956 to improve deteriorating and dangerous conditions in the national parks that largely resulted from a massive boom in visitors after World War II. Mission 66 expanded visitor capacity in the national parks to accommodate an estimated eighty million automobile tourists within ten years. The program called for adding more overnight accommodations, building visitor centers, and constructing park roads. The roadway debate continued in 1957, when the Washington State legislature authorized a survey for a cross-Cascades highway. On September 2, 1972, the highway, known as the North Cascades Highway, officially opened, to the dismay of NCCC members. Another debate began in 1961 regarding the Outdoor Advertising Act, which established billboard control along scenic highways. The NCCC called for more aggressive controls and restrictions of outdoor advertising than the controversial act established in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the Northwest. Â¶ Over the past third of a century, the NCCC has accomplished much in conservation, including the creation of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Glacier Peak Wilderness, William O. Douglas Wilderness (Cougar Lakes Wilderness Area), Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Mt. Baker Wilderness, Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, and others. The NCCC has also collaborated with British Columbia allies to block the raising of Ross Dam and to encourage the establishment of a U.S.-Canadian international park. In addition, the NCCC newsletter, The Wild Cascades, has kept its members and other conservationists informed of and dedicated to the various issues affecting the North Cascades. The North Cascades Conservation Council has been a leader in the protection and preservation of the North Cascades mountain range from the Columbia River to the U.S.-Canadian border. Â¶ "

Langlie papers,"If not for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909, Arthur Bernard Langlie (July 25, 1900 - July 24, 1966) probably would never have become governor of Washington. He was born in Minnesota to Scandinavian immigrants on August 25th, 1900. His family moved repeatedly throughout Minnesota and North Dakota during his early childhood. After a fire destroyed his parents' hotel in 1909, they planned to try their luck in Montana. Bjarne Langlie, Arthur's father, discovered that because of special rates encouraging visits to the Exposition, a rail ticket to Seattle cost no more than one to Montana. He decided to check out the prospects in the Puget Sound region instead, and as a result the family settled in Bremerton. Â¶ Arthur attended the University of Washington, eventually receiving a law degree. He practiced in Seattle, and by the mid-1930s became involved in municipal reform. He served as mayor from 1938 to 1940, and led the effort to rehabilitate the city after the Great Depression, restoring a sense of stability, efficiency, and business-as-usual, along with the more tangible benefits of federal aid. In 1940, he became the Republican gubernatorial nominee, and won thanks largely to a deeply divided Democratic party. Bruising battles with both the legislature and with other state offices characterized his term, and he lost his re-election bid to U.S. Senator Monrad C. Wallgren. Langlie ran against Wallgren again in 1948, and avenged his defeat. In the subsequent election he became the first Washington state governor to win a third term. In 1956, at the urging of President Eisenhower, Langlie challenged, unsuccessfully, Warren G. Magnuson's seat in the Senate. After this defeat, he decided to return to private life even though Eisenhower offered him a number of prominent positions in the federal government. Until his retirement in 1964, Langlie served as president, and later board chairman, of McCall's Corporation, and oversaw the rejuvenation of the publishing company. He died in Seattle, one day shy of his 66th birthday. "

1885-003,"Paul, William Lewis, 1885-1977",William Lewis Paul invitation to building dedication,"William Lewis Paul (1885-1977) was a pioneering Indian rights attorney and a leading figure in the campaign for native Alaskan rights. Paul was born in 1885 to parents who both had Tlingit mothers and European fathers. His mother, Matilda Kinnan Paul (Tamaree), was a Presbyterian missionary who worked at the Sitka Industrial Training School. Paul was educated at this school and later at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. He adopted the Carlisle School's assimilationist ideals and its assertion that Indians should have the same rights and privileges as other American citizens. Paul later graduated from Whitworth College in Spokane and studied law through correspondence courses offered by LaSalle University. In 1920 he returned to Alaska. His brother Louis was Grand Secretary of the Alaska Native Brotherhood (ANB), and he convinced William to stay in Alaska and work for the ANB. Â¶ The Paul brothers dominated the ANB from 1920 to 1940. William was elected Grand Secretary in 1920, the same year he passed the bar, making him the first Alaska native attorney. The ANB re-elected him Grand Secretary in 1921, 1922, 1935, 1938, and 1951. He won the office of Grand President in 1928, 1929, and 1955. Louis served as Grand Secretary twice and as Grand President three times between 1919 and 1939. The ANB, founded in 1912 by Tlingit Presbyterians associated with the Sitka Industrial Training School, originally saw its mission as civilizing the Indians of Southeast Alaska. In 1915 the ANB successfully lobbied the territorial legislature to pass a law giving citizenship and voting rights to natives who learned English and held jobs in the cash economy. The Pauls retained the ANB's focus on assimilating and Christianizing Indians. They argued, however, that Alaska natives were already US citizens by birth, and were therefore entitled to the rights and privileges associated with citizenship. The district court finally adopted this position in 1922, when William Paul successfully defended the right of his brother's father-in-law to vote in US vs. Charlie Jones. Â¶ William Paul made the ANB a major force in Alaskan politics. He spent much of the early 1920s organizing new ANB chapters throughout southeast Alaska, boosting membership from 100 in 1920 to 2,200 by 1935. He also started and edited a newspaper, Alaska Fisherman, published in Ketchikan from 1923 to 1932. The paper devoted much of its space to denouncing white cannery owners who monopolized native fishing grounds. William Paul used his newspaper and his ANB connections to great advantage in his successful 1924 and 1926 campaigns for the Alaska legislature, becoming the first native Alaskan to serve in that body. He passed a bill that made Alaska natives eligible to receive assistance under the territory's widows, orphans, and old age pension laws. Paul also fended off a challenge to native voting rights in the form of a literacy test. The law passed, but Paul amended it to exclude from its provisions all those who had previously voted. Without this amendment, the literacy test would have disenfranchised most of the native population. Charges that Paul accepted campaign contributions from canneries cost him his bid for re-election in 1928. He also lost his campaigns for territorial attorney general in 1930 and 1932. Nonetheless, Paul continued his successful private law practice. He tried many Indian rights cases, including one that forced the Ketchikan public schools to accept Indian children in 1929. Â¶ In the mid 1930s, William Paul worked for the ANB in Washington, DC. He authored a bill that allowed the Tlingit and Haida Indians to sue the government in a test case to determine the validity of their land claims; Congress passed this law in 1935. Paul was also instrumental in extending the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) to Alaska in 1936. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) then hired Paul to help villages draft IRA constitutions. Paul, however, suffered several setbacks in the late 1930s. In 1937 the Alaska Bar Association prohibited Paul from practicing law on the grounds that he had defrauded a client. The BIA fired Paul shortly thereafter. Â¶ The ANB was divided sharply over whether to allow William Paul a major role in planning the Tlingit-Haida land claims suit. Paul would not be readmitted to the Bar until January 1959. His disbarment reduced his influence in the ANB, which turned to the rival Peratrovich family for leadership. Nonetheless, the BIA required the Haida and Tlingit to form a joint council to decide how to prosecute the suit and how to distribute the benefits, and Paul was elected head of this council in 1941. The Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska (CCTHITA), founded in 1935, became one of the leading organizations campaigning for native Alaskan rights from the 1940s onwards. Paul's two sons, William Lackey Paul (often referred to as William L. Paul, Jr.) and Louis Frederick Paul (known as Fred Paul), were designated attorneys for the case against the government. The BIA and the Peratroviches removed the Pauls from the case in 1944, hiring instead the nationally known attorney James Curry. Â¶ William Paul dissented from Curry's contention that the Tlingit and Haida were distinct tribal groups whose land holdings had been usurped by whites. Paul argued that the â€˜Tlingit' and â€˜Haida', as represented by the CCTHIA, reflected linguistic rather than tribal groupings. He believed that class action for Native lands claims must be brought by individual tribes rather than the CCTHIA. Paul helped BIA Commissioner Dillon Meyer remove Curry from the case in 1953, forcing the Tlingit and Haida to hire attorney Israel Weissbrodt. Meanwhile, Paul and his sons, despite great opposition from the ANB, brought a series of cases designed to force the courts to accept Paul's theories about the Haida and Tlingit claims. The cases culminated with Tee-Hit-Ton vs. US (1955). The Supreme Court stated that compensation could not be awarded for Native Land Claims unless recognized specifically by Congress, and rejected Paul's theory about the Tlingit and Haida. The CCTHIA was later re-organized, however, in order to reflect more accurately tribal structures in Southeast Alaska. Although considered a setback for Native rights, the Tee-Hit-Ton case did not end the Tlingit-Haida Land Claims action. The Court of Claims ruled in 1959 that the Tlingit and Haida had occupied and owned the entire area of southeast Alaska at the time the state was purchased by the US in 1867. Compensation of $7.5 million was awarded to the CCTHIA in 1968. Organizations including the ANB and the Alaska Federation of Natives International would continue meanwhile to campaign for Native land claim settlements across Alaska. Â¶ Paul moved to Seattle following the Tee-Hit-Ton case, and became gradually less active within the ANB. He adopted the role of an advisor rather than a leader within the organization. He frequently sent open letters to the ANB membership that set out his goals for the organization and his opinions of its leaders' policies. Although he was not active in the passage of the landmark 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, his sons were and corresponded with him on the matter. The settlement awarded both land and compensation to Alaskan Natives, to be administered by twelve regional corporations within the state and one outside. Paul would remain involved with Native rights issues and organizations through the final years of his life. He practiced law as late as 1972, and paid active dues to the Alaska Bar Association until 1974. William Lewis Paul died in 1977. Â¶ "

1908-001,"Andrews, Emery E., 1894-1976",Emery E. Andrews papers,"Emery E. Andrews was an esteemed pastor at Seattle's Japanese Baptist Church who devoted the bulk of his adult life to ministering to Japanese communities in Washington State, the U.S., and Japan. Born July 29, 1894, in Albion, Nebraska, \""Andy\"" moved with his family at age two to a farm outside Modesto, California. At age ten he became a member of his local First Baptist Church and was licensed to preach at age 19, one year before he graduated from high school. For the next three years he pursued theological training at the Bible Institute of Los Angeles and in 1916 was married to Mary Brooks in Orting, Washington, a small town in the foothills of Mt. Rainier. In 1917, he was ordained to the ministry by his home church in Modesto, California. There, he worked among the local Italian and Mexican communities while attending Los Angeles Junior College. Â¶ In 1919, he and his wife and infant daughter moved to Seattle, where Reverend Andrews worked at the Cosmopolitan Mission while attending the University of Washington. After receiving a B.A. in Sociology in 1922 and a Five-year Teaching Diploma in 1929, Rev. Andrews became pastor to the Nisei community at the Japanese Baptist Church. He received his second B.A., in Education, from the University of Washington in 1931. Â¶ The start of the War in the Pacific in late 1941 -- and the subsequent, rapid forced removal of tens of thousands of persons of Japanese descent to incarceration centers throughout the West in 1942 -- was a major turning point in Rev. Andrews's ministry and life. The entire congregation that he served for thirteen years suddenly absent, Rev. Andrews made almost daily visits to the Camp Harmony Assembly Center in Puyallup, Washington. When inmates were transferred to the Minidoka relocation center in Hunt, Idaho, in September 1942, Rev. Andrews and his family moved to the nearby town of Twin Falls so that he could continue to minister to the Japanese. There, he leased a home much larger than his family needed in order to provide a stopping-off place for Japanese going to and from the center (an average of 167 Japanese visited the house every month). In addition, from 1942-1945, he made fifty-six trips from Twin Falls -- covering 1,500 miles each time -- to retrieve cars and other goods stored for Japanese Americans at the Japanese Baptist Church in Seattle. He also traveled extensively to other incarceration centers. Â¶ Rev. Andrews' commitment to Japanese Americans during World War II involved extraordinary personal sacrifices and risks. Because of his association with the inmates at Minidoka, he was refused service in a Twin Falls cafe. Several months later the cafe owner purchased the house Rev. Andrews had leased and ordered him to move. He was also, for a brief time, the subject of an F.B.I. investigation. Â¶ In January 1945, he and his family returned to their farm near Seattle and reopened the Japanese Baptist Church the following year. Rev. Andrews spent the summers of 1949 and 1951 as a volunteer for \""Houses of Hiroshima,\"" a private relief organization formed by pacifist/writer Floyd Schmoe to rebuild homes for victims of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Â¶ Rev. Andrews resigned as pastor of the church in December 1955 and was asked at that time to continue as the Minister of Visitation. He retired in 1959 and was named Pastor Emeritus. In 1970, the Emperor of Japan awarded Rev. Andrews the Fifth Order of the Sacred Treasure. He died of a heart attack in 1976 at the age of 81. Â¶ "

0036-001,"Bagley, Clarence, 1843-1932",Clarence Bagley papers,"From his arrival in Seattle in 1860 until his death in 1932 at the age of eighty-eight, Clarence Bagley was concerned with the growth of Washington as a Territory and State in general, and Seattle's growth as a city in particular. Soon after their arrival and his father's appointment as University Commissioner, Bagley became a clerk in the Surveyor General's office in 1866, shortly after his marriage to Alice Mercer. Â¶ This move brought him directly into politics and into the printing trade as well. While working in the Surveyor General's office in Olympia, Bagley came under the tutelage of Randall Hewitt, owner of the Territorial Republican and the Temperance Echo. With L. G. Abbott he bought the Echo in 1868 but sold his interest shortly thereafter and took employment with the Commercial Age, organ of the Republican Party. When this newspaper was discontinued in 1870, he returned to Seattle, remaining until May 1871, when he became deputy in the internal revenue office, holding the position until 1873. While in this office he worked with the Puget Sound Courier, finally buying it in 1873, and emerging as Territorial Printer for the next ten years. He sold the Courier and the printing office in 1884, returning to Seattle to stay in 1885 after a brief interval in Portland as a deputy collector of internal revenue. Â¶ By now a confirmed publisher, Clarence Bagley joined with others and purchased the Post-Intelligencer in 1886, which he managed until L. S. J. Hunt took it over that same year. Other ephemeral ventures followed, one in banking and one again in newspapers, joining with Homer Hill for two years in publishing the Daily Press. Â¶ In 1890 he was elected to the House of Delegates of the City Council from where he fought open gambling and Seattle's \""open town\"" policy with the result that doors were barred on many of the \""gambling hells. \"" Following upon this experience in elective office he acted as an adviser in writing the 1893 city charter, contributing clauses affecting assessments for local improvements. Â¶ From 1893 until his appointment as Secretary of the Board of Public Works in 1900, he worked in the City Comptroller's office. He continued as Secretary of the Board until his retirement in 1929. These experiences in city government and his ever-present concern for governmental efficiency led him to become candidate in 1909 for the Republican nomination for councilman from the Eighth Ward. He announced his candidacy in letters to friends, but did not actively canvass his ward for votes. He stressed his alarm with what, in his opinion, was a growing trend toward mismanagement and extravagance in city affairs. Promising a \""square deal, \"" Bagley felt this could be changed with a business-like economy and management terminating in better, cleaner government. Â¶ The election itself, with its many side issues, was unsettling for him as he associated political reporting with what he considered to be honestly partisan, and took exception to the methods used by 1910 newspapermen, not only in his own case but on behalf of all the candidates. He lost the election to Elbert F. Blaine, and explained that the loss was due to his association with the \""City Hall Gang, \"" whom the voters had rejected completely. Â¶ Until this point in his career, he appears to have been a public servant first and a historian second. Now his interest in historical writing resurfaced. He had begun two years previously to edit the manuscripts of William I. Marshall's Acquisition of Oregon. Marshall, whom Bagley had met in 1905, had devoted twenty years to disproving the \""Whitman Saved Oregon\"" myth, and after his death in 1906, Bagley and Thompson Coit Elliott, both interested in seeing the work published, joined to edit the manuscript and to assist the widow financially. Â¶ Despite feeling that his position with the Board of Public Works took too much time away from historical study, he stayed on as Secretary, editing Marshall's work for publication in his spare time; it appeared in 1911. This was followed by publication of articles in historical quarterlies and journals, and in 1916, The History of Seattle appeared, culminating more than two years of research. Â¶ With publication of this work, Clarence Bagley's often-expressed dream of writing the history of his region was becoming a reality. He had little sympathy for writers who romanticized the facts of history into fiction that bore little or no resemblance to actuality. However, his view of \""actuality\"" was restricted by rigid adherence to the \""pioneer code\"" on the one hand and self-imposed limitations on the other, as he illustrated in a letter to Edmond S. Meany in 1911: Â¶ \""Sometime I shall write a history of Seattle, and while what I shall say will be the truth I shall not give all the truth. I shall rake up no old stories of evil. \"" Â¶ His activities were not confined to writing. He gave his time freely in efforts to organize pioneer societies and similar groups, frequently being called upon for speeches and public appearances in connection with pioneer-inspired celebrations. Â¶ In 1905 he had become deeply involved in a dispute between the historical societies of Seattle and Tacoma. Consolidation of effort and location under the aegis of the State was suggested by the Seattle group when its members (including Meany, Cornelius Hanford, Thomas Burke, Roger S. Greene and John P. Hoyt) decided that the Tacoma society was \""dead. \"" Most of the members of the Seattle group had aided in founding the Washington State Historical Society in 1891. But the early years turned into a struggle for mere existence which Bagley et al regarded as a hindrance to accomplishment of the Society's original purposes of collection and preservation of historical source materials. This suggestion revitalized the slumbering rivalry of the two cities and the battle was joined. Bagley became the unofficial spokesman for the Washington University State Historical Society which had been newly founded. In a letter to Professor J.N. Bowman of the State Normal School in Bellingham, he explained: Â¶ \""Experience had proved that the Societies thus allied with State Universities have done the best work, and that this will be true here.\"" Â¶ Proposals of merger were not accepted by Tacoma, and the Washington State Historical Society remained a separate body. Unallied with the Tacoma group in either effort or ideals, Bagley was elected president of the Washington University State Historical Society, and under his leadership the work of collecting and preserving original data was begun. His vision of a central repository for historical research materials was challenged once again in 1915, when the King County Historical Society sought allocation of land on University-owned property. Â¶ In a letter to Winlock W. Miller of Seattle, Bagley called for a \""concert of action in historical efforts, \"" insisting that \""I have seen so many similar efforts live a precarious existence and finally die from slow decay that I may be permitted to express doubts as to the long life or active work of the present one.\"" Â¶ In the public mind Bagley symbolized Pacific Northwest history in many ways. The post-office delivered letters to him addressed merely \""Historian, Seattle, Washington;\"" newspapers of the city began to refer to him affectionately as \""Pop, \"" and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce directed all of its inquiries on historical matters to his desk in City Hall. Â¶ In 1929 he brought out his History of King County. With retirement, articles and pamphlets began to appear with regularity. Indian Myths of the Northwest, \""compiled, annotated and expurgated\"" as he wrote to a friend, was published in 1930. Â¶ Plans for future publications simmered. Clarence Bagley began 1932 with letters to friends expressing enthusiasm for his many historical projects, and often a small boast regarding his health. He was proud of the two-mile walk he took each day from his home on Seattle's Queen Anne hill \""to town, rain or shine. \"" But a lingering cold developed into pneumonia, and on February 17, 1932, \""Pop\"" Bagley died.

In 1932, in reponse to the growing need for the cooperation and coordination of these clubs, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs (FWOC) was organized\"" (from FWOC pamphlet). Â¶ This coalition of hiking and outdoor recreation groups works to promote environmental conservation in the eight western states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, as well as Alaska and Western Canada. Annual conventions, held primarily in California, Oregon, and Washington, have been held by FWOC since 1932, gathering delegates from member clubs to decide federation positions on conservation issues. Resolutions are submitted during and before each conference by members and club officials. The official resolutions are subsequently used to urge legislators, public officials, and private bodies to work for conservation goals. Annual reports are submitted by the federation's elected officials, and FWOC has also kept member clubs informed about new developments in the preservation of the West's natural resources through an annual periodical. Published as Western Outdoor Quarterly from 1933 to 1969, and then as Western Outdoors Annual from 1970 to 1975, Outdoors West continues as FWOC's official publication. Â¶ FWOC's mission is to create a strong regional alliance of organizations dedicated to environmental protection. Working together, member clubs helped secure passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. They made important contributions to the establishment of the North Cascades National Park and the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in Washington State, as well as to the establishment of various wilderness areas in the national forests of Oregon and California. FWOC also helped to ensure the establishment of a national monument in the Sierra Nevada range to protect the remaining Giant Sequoia trees. Â¶ For some twenty years, FWOC shared a Northwest conservation representative with the Sierra Club to ensure further representation of the area's conservation goals. Michael McCloskey was first to hold the position (1961-1964), followed by Rodger Pegues (1964-1967). Brock Evans held the position from 1967 until 1973, when he became the Washington, D.C. representative. Roger Mellem was the acting Northwest conservation representative for 1973. Doug Scott continued the position until 1978, followed by the last representative, Jim Blomquist (1978-1980).

He was born in Minnesota to Scandinavian immigrants on August 25th, 1900. His family moved repeatedly throughout Minnesota and North Dakota during his early childhood. After a fire destroyed his parents' hotel in 1909, they planned to try their luck in Montana. Bjarne Langlie, Arthur's father, discovered that because of special rates encouraging visits to the Exposition, a rail ticket to Seattle cost no more than one to Montana. He decided to check out the prospects in the Puget Sound region instead, and as a result the family settled in Bremerton. Â¶ Arthur attended the University of Washington, eventually receiving a law degree. He practiced in Seattle, and by the mid-1930s became involved in municipal reform. He served as mayor from 1938 to 1940, and led the effort to rehabilitate the city after the Great Depression, restoring a sense of stability, efficiency, and business-as-usual, along with the more tangible benefits of federal aid. In 1940, he became the Republican gubernatorial nominee, and won thanks largely to a deeply divided Democratic party. Bruising battles with both the legislature and with other state offices characterized his term, and he lost his re-election bid to U.S. Senator Monrad C. Wallgren. Langlie ran against Wallgren again in 1948, and avenged his defeat. In the subsequent election he became the first Washington state governor to win a third term. In 1956, at the urging of President Eisenhower, Langlie challenged, unsuccessfully, Warren G. Magnuson's seat in the Senate. After this defeat, he decided to return to private life even though Eisenhower offered him a number of prominent positions in the federal government. Until his retirement in 1964, Langlie served as president, and later board chairman, of McCall's Corporation, and oversaw the rejuvenation of the publishing company.

1940-005,AFL-CIO. King County Labor Council of Washington,"Martin Luther King, Jr. County Labor Council records","The King County Labor Council has long been the communal decision-making body of the various union locals in King County. From the mid-1920s until the reunification of the AFL and CIO in 1955, only AFL-affiliated unions were represented on the Council. At other times, however, the vast majority of King County's locals had a voice on the Council.

The Council has passed through at least four distinct periods in its history. The Council originally began in 1888 as the Western Central Labor Union. This body changed its name to the Central Labor Council of Seattle and Vicinity in 1905. These groups occasionally joined coalitions with Populists and other reform groups in local and state politics. Nonetheless, much of the early Council's energy was spent simply trying to survive. The second phase of the Council's history began roughly in 1914 with the labor shortage that allowed unions to organize much of Seattle. The Council grew increasingly radical in this period and became the dominant force in Seattle's powerful progressive coalition. The loss of the Council's power began with the mass layoffs of shipyard workers after World War I. These layoffs led the Council to call the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the only truly city-wide general strike in American history. Employers responded to the failed strike with an open shop drive that de-unionized most of King County. A series of internal power struggles plagued the Council after the strike. The Council voted to expel members of the Industrial Workers of the World in late 1919 and Communist Party members in 1925.

The growing conservative influence in the Council was solidified when Dave Beck and his Teamsters came to dominate the group in the late 1920s. The third phase of the Council's history was thus business unionism, Beck-style. Dave Beck began his career as a driver for the Council's cooperative laundry but rapidly rose to become the chief Teamster organizer west of the Rockies. Beck used the strategic position of truck drivers in the economy to start rebuilding the strength of organized labor in Seattle. If the Council declared a firm to be \""unfair to labor,\"" he could often prevent the firm from trucking its goods to market. Despite Beck's occasionally ruthless tactics, he believed that businesses had a right to make a profit. When the Great Depression spurred widespread organizing drives, many firms concluded that they would much rather deal with the avowedly anti-radical Beck than with a CIO union. The Council routinely backed Beck in his jurisdictional disputes with CIO and independent unions. Thus, by the end of World War II, Seattle was largely a closed-shop AFL town. Under Beck's reign, the Council stayed fairly aloof from politics, endorsing moderate pro-labor Democrats and spurning the leftist coalitions that fought for local and state offices.

The fourth stage of the Council's history, its reentry into local politics, began with the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955. The expanded Council was quickly put on the defensive by statewide right-to-work proposals in Initiative 198 in 1956 and Initiative 202 in 1958. The Council played a leading role in the campaigns that defeated these measures. After these victories, the Council went on the offensive. It started a pro-labor public relations campaign in 1959 that included donating money to charities and promoting radio and television appearances by labor leaders. Beginning in 1964, the Council's Committee on Political Education launched major voter registration drives before elections. The growth of public sector unions in the 1950s and 1960s, coupled with the addition of progressive CIO unions, led the Council to endorse expanded social services and public housing in this period. The Council also supported the efforts of Seattle civil rights groups during the 1960s. Nonetheless, the Council retained some traces of business unionism. It gave a no-strike pledge during the 1962 World's Fair and often helped the Chamber of Commerce lobby for subsidies for local businesses.

During the latter years of the 20th century, the period documented in Accession 1940-2, the council's executive secretaries were, in succession: James K. Bender, Dan Bickford, Ron Judd, and Steve Williamson.

In 2005, the name changed to Martin Luther King County Labor Council, commonly referred to as MLK Labor.

Infuriated by the impending loss of this forest, he left his private law practice and dedicated himself full-time to fighting environmental destruction. Â¶ Within very little time, Evans established himself as one of the leading environmentalists in the Pacific Northwest. From 1967 to 1973 he was the Northwest Representative for the Sierra Club and represented the Audubon Society through the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. As the Sierra Club Representative, he also was a co-founder of the Washington Environmental Council in 1968. During this time He became heavily active in state and regional environmental issues during this time. He organized citizen support and was the primary lobbyist in Washington State during the final crucial years when legislation was being formulated to establish North Cascades National Park. He led efforts to ensure that key parcels were included in the Pasayten and Glacier Peak Wilderness areas. His efforts led to renewed strength for campaigns to gain wilderness protection for the Alpine Lakes and other unprotected regions in the Cascades. In 1972 he received the Environmentalist of the Year award from the Washington Environmental Council. Â¶ In 1973, Evans moved into the national arena when he was named Director of the Sierra Club's Washington, D.C. office. In this position he lobbied Congress as well as administrative agencies, state and local governments, and other organizations on a wide range of environmental issues. Preserving Hell's Canyon was one of the major issues during his time at the Sierra Club. Private and public utility companies had wanted to dam this 100 mile stretch of Idaho's Snake River for over two decades, but had been unable to do so because of disputes about who would build and control the dam. In the 1970's, these energy interests came together and appeared able and willing to cooperate enough to undertake the project, but Evans set a historic precedent by filing the first environmental lawsuit in the Northwest against the dams. Then he, along with other environmentalists, successfully lobbied for federal legislation in 1975 that prevented any dam construction, legislation that Evans drafted himself. Â¶ During his time with the Sierra Club, Evans continued to gain a higher profile and a reputation as an outstanding lobbyist and leader. In 1977, U.S. News and World Report named him one of the most influential lobbyists in Washington, D.C., as did Fortune in 1982, showing not only his own strength, but the lobbying strength and legitimacy that environmentalists had gained. During this time he also served on the Environmental Advisory Board of the Army Corps of Engineers. Â¶ In 1981, Evans became the National Audubon Society's Vice-President for National Issues where he remained until 1996. During his career with the Audubon Society, the preservation of old growth forests in the Pacific Northwest was a major focus for Evans, as it had been throughout his career as an environmental advocate. Evans feared that timber companies were logging old growth forests too quickly and that the nation's ancient forests would soon be gone if nothing were changed. He believed that the ancient forest ecosystem could not be preserved by clear cutting patches of trees, as the Forest Service allowed timber companies to do. Â¶ Many of Evans's efforts to save ancient forests involved lobbying Congress, which had the power to change Forest Service policies and increase or limit logging in specific areas. In the mid 1980's, Evans and the Audubon Society directed much of their lobbying efforts toward Congressional appropriations committees, but met with only limited success. Evans and the Audubon Society then changed their strategy and teamed up with other environmental organizations to form the Ancient Forest Alliance. One of the coalition's new strategies involved focusing on the enforcement of existing laws to preserve forests, and the spotted owl soon became a central component of this strategy. The number of spotted owls was declining significantly because of logging in old growth forests. Environmentalists and biologists believed that the spotted owl was a \""management indicator species\"" and that its fortune was an indicator of the entire group of species in the old growth forests. For people such as Evans, the demise of this animal bolstered their belief in the importance of preserving the ancient forest ecosystem, but the owl's demise also gave them a new opportunity to prevent future logging. Because of the federal Endangered Species Act, which mandated the preservation of ecosystems that supported endangered species, classifying the owl as endangered would prevent logging in areas where they existed. However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was reluctant to list the owl as endangered, which Evans and others alleged was a result of timber industry influence and not because of scientific research. Because of environmentalists' litigious efforts, the federal courts in 1990 forced the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the spotted owl as \""threatened\"" and issued an injunction forbidding further habitatae destruction. These decisions were major victories for environmentalists and ended logging in many areas of ancient forests where spotted owls were believed to live. Â¶ Despite this victory, political battles over ancient forests continued between environmentalists and logging interests. Evans and others tried to press for more protected areas while logging interests tried to portray environmentalists as people who cared more about spotted owls than about loggers and the communities that depended on the timber industry. In 1993, the newly elected president Bill Clinton called a forest summit in Portland, Oregon to try to find compromise between logging interest and environmentalists. As a leader of one of the largest environmental organizations, Evans participated in the summit. Â¶ Another major issue for Evans during his time with the Audubon Society was the preservation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), located along the northern coast of Alaska. In the late 1980's, oil interest believed that there might be huge oil reserves in the Refuge but needed special legislation to open it to drilling. In 1989, a bill to allow drilling in the ANWR was about to pass through Congress when it suddenly was shelved because of the anti-oil backlash after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Nonetheless, legislation to open the refuge continued to surface in the early 1990's, but Evans, along with other environmentalists, was able to block its passage through Congress. After 1992, bills to open the refuge did pass through Congress on more than one occasion, but with President Clinton sure to veto such legislation, Evans and other environmentalists gave the issue less attention. Â¶ Throughout most of his environmental career, Evans took a pragmatic approach to conservation and at times received harsh criticism from those who said he was willing to compromise. This tension was often evident between local grassroots organizations, including chapters of the Audubon Society, and D.C.-based groups such as the Sierra Club and Audubon offices that Evans helped guide. However, on at least on occasion, Evans took a militant stance when he, along with a former U.S. Representative, Jim Jontz, and other environmental activists, was arrested in 1995 for blocking a logging road in Oregon's Siskiyou National Forest. Evans was protesting what was known as the \""Salvage Rider\"" that allowed tree cutting but had passed into law only because it was attached to an important piece of unrelated legislation. Â¶ During his time with the Audubon Society, Evans continued to undertake many activities both related and unrelated to the society's work. In 1984, he ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives from Washington's first congressional district. In the mid 1980's, he helped found and served on the Board of Directors of the Coast Alliance, an organization that tried to influence the government's coastal zone management plans. From 1985 until 1991, Evans was the Washington, D.C. representative of the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, and from 1989 to 1991 was on the Board of Directors of the Boundary Waters Wilderness Foundation. The Foundation raised funds and tried to expand the Boundary Waters Wilderness, as well as outlaw the use of motor vehicles for portaging. Throughout much of the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's, Evans was on the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation voters and chaired its Political Strategy Committee. For the League, Evans helped review and choose political candidates for the group's endorsements. From 1989 to 1994, he was also on the Board of Directors of the Environmental Law Institute, a think tank for members of the American Environmental Bar. Evans also was a board member for RESTORE: The North Woods, a grassroots organization that pushed for forestland protection in the North Woods eco region (a region extending over the northern tier of states from Maine to Minnesota). He also served on the Steering Committee of the Environmental Coalition for North America in the late l980's. Â¶ The overlapping issues of race and the environmental activism surfaced many times during Evans's career. From 1984 to 1991 he was a board member for the Human Environment Center, an organization that tried to bridge the gap between mostly white, middle-class environmentalists, and underprivileged minorities who typically had little involvement in the movement. The Center focused largely on the environmental problems of the cities, especially those that affected mostly poor minority groups, and tried to get minorities more involved in environmental issues. In the early 1990's, the issue of race and environment again took center stage when Evans helped found the Green Wave Movement. The Movement's goal was \""to restore American life and the American continent\"" and creates \""the foundation of a new green society based on the principles of environmental justice and a sustainable economy.\"" However, the group became divided over internal issues, mostly focusing on the homogeneity of its leaders, which critics believed was paradigmatic of the environmental movement as a whole. For Evans, it was a difficult and frustrating experience and he stepped down from the Steering Committee to open a position for someone other than a white male. Â¶ After retiring as Vice-President for the Audubon Society in 1996, Evans remained in Washington, D.C. as a lobbying consultant and in this capacity has continued working for environmental groups. In 1997 Evans became President of the Endangered Species Coalition in Washington, D.C. The Coalition is an association of 450 environmental, scientific, and religious groups dedicated to protecting and strengthening the Endangered Species Act. Â¶ "

00-058,University of Washington. Faculty Senate,"University of Washington, Faculty Senate records","The University of Washington's Faculty Senate serves as the legislative body of the University Faculty, charged with the responsibility for establishing policies, rules, and regulations for the entire University. The Faculty Senate is composed of approximately 200 senators, elected to two-year terms by their departmental colleagues. Senators are voting members of the faculty with the ranks of assistant professor, associate professor or professor. A senator can serve no more than two successive two-year terms; faculty members who serve two terms or who are not reelected for a second consecutive term are ineligible for Senate membership for four years. Â¶ Approximately one senator is elected for every 15 faculty members in a department. In departments with fewer than 12 members, the senator represents a voting unit comprised of two or more departments. In addition to the elected senators, the Faculty Senate includes as voting members the President of the University and the chairs of the Faculty Councils. Other members of the University Community, such as certain administrators, and the presidents of the ASUW and GPSS, are members of the Senate with the right to speak, but without vote. Â¶ The Senate maintains three officers: Chair, Vice Chair, and Secretary. The Chair and Vice Chair are the elected officers of the Faculty Senate with terms beginning on 16 September. The Vice Chair becomes Chair the following year. The Senate Chair presides at Senate meetings, chairs the Senate Executive Committee (SEC), coordinates the work of the Faculty Councils, recommends action on faculty requests for information, and represents the Senate and the faculty in public explanations of Senate actions. The Vice Chair for the following academic year is elected by the Faculty Senate at its first meeting of Winter Quarter. Any voting member of the faculty is eligible for nomination and election. Normally, the Vice Chair has been active in faculty governance and is able to represent the faculty and its interests. If the Vice Chair is not already an elected senator, he or she serves ex officio with vote in the Senate. The Vice Chair serves as chair of the Senate Committee on Planning and Budgeting (SCPB) and reports to the Senate the recommendations of the SEC. In the absence of the Senate Chair, the Vice Chair presides at Senate and SEC meetings. Â¶ The Secretary of the Faculty is a tenured member of the faculty appointed by the President from a list of nominees submitted by the SEC. Included among the Secretary's duties are: keeping the minutes and records of the Faculty Senate and SEC, establishing the agenda for SEC meetings, administering the Senate Office, and providing lists of nominees for committee appointments. In addition, the Secretary serves on the SCPB, oversees Senate elections, manages the official materials associated with Adjudication Proceedings (Faculty Code, Chapter 28) and Program Eliminations (Faculty Code, Section 26-41), maintains the University Handbook, and is available to faculty for consultation and advice about University rules and regulations. Â¶ The Senate also appoints a Faculty Legislative Representative and a Deputy Legislative Representative at its first Spring Quarter meeting. Serving one-year terms commencing 16 September, the Representatives speak on behalf of the faculty and of faculty interests to the executive and legislative arms of state government. Both the Legislative Representative and the Deputy attend sessions of the State Legislature, appear before legislative committees on the faculty's behalf, and generally work to keep the faculty informed of legislative matters in Olympia (and elsewhere), and keep legislators informed of faculty concerns and interests. The Faculty Legislative Representative or the Deputy Legislative Representative serves ex officio on the SEC, the Senate, the Faculty Council on Faculty Affairs, the Faculty Council on Research, the Faculty Council on University Facilities and Services, and the Faculty Council on University Relations. Â¶ The Faculty Senate carries out its responsibilities with the assistance of a number of faculty committees. As the principal advisory bodies to the Senate, the twelve Faculty Councils are responsible for overseeing specific aspects of University policy and operations, for making policy recommendations and developing proposed legislation, for reporting resolutions and other actions to the SEC and the Senate, and for interpreting (or obtaining interpretation) of policy regarding matters under their jurisdiction. Faculty Councils are responsible, for example, for formulating policy on educational issues; student conduct and activities; scholastic policy; procedures for faculty appointment, tenure, and promotion; libraries; and other University facilities and services. The Councils also monitor the University's compliance with policies and procedures and make recommendations for implementation of rules and regulations. In addition to the Faculty Councils, the Senate has three committees of its own: the Senate Executive Committee, the Senate Committee on Planning and Budgeting, and the Advisory Committee on Faculty Code and Regulations. Â¶ The SEC determines the agenda for Faculty Senate meetings, assists the Senate in conducting its business, and provides a channel of communication between the President and the faculty. This involves regular interaction with the Faculty Councils, requesting and receiving reports, making recommendations for action by the Faculty Senate, nominating members of Councils and committees, and transmitting to the Senate any item requested by at least ten percent of the voting members of the faculty. Meetings of the SEC are held at least ten days before each regular meeting of the Senate. The SEC contains voting and non-voting members. Voting members include the Senate Chair (who presides over the SEC), the Senate Vice Chair, the President of the University (or a designated representative), the elected Group Representatives, and the chairs of the faculty organizations of the Bothell and Tacoma campuses. A number of ex officio members have a right to speak but not to vote on matters before the SEC. These include the chairs of Faculty Councils, the Faculty Legislative Representative (and/or the Deputy Legislative Representative), the presidents of the GPSS and the ASUW, and the Secretary of the Faculty. Regularly invited guests include the Provost, and the Special Assistant to the President. In addition, the President may invite administrative officers to attend in order to provide information and participate in discussion of agenda items related to their responsibilities. Â¶ The SCPB advises the administration on the University budget and plans for the future of the University. It also regularly informs the Faculty Senate on University budgeting and planning issues. The committee has twelve faculty members, three administrative members, and three student members. Faculty include the Senate Vice Chair (who chairs the committee), the Senate Chair, the Faculty Legislative Representative and Deputy Legislative Representative, the immediate past Chair of the Faculty Senate, the Secretary of the Faculty, and six at-large faculty members serving overlapping three-year terms. Administrative members serve with vote and include the Provost, the Vice Provost for Planning and Budgeting, and a representative from the Board of Deans. Student members include the presidents of the GPSS and the ASUW, who serve one-year terms ex officio without vote, and a student member nominated jointly by GPSS and ASUW, who serves a one-year term with vote. Â¶ The Advisory Committee on Faculty Code and Regulations reviews all proposed Class A legislation following first consideration by the Senate. The committee is appointed by, and is advisory to, the SEC; it is responsible for making recommendations on proposed legislation's clarity, precision, and compliance with the existing provisions of the Faculty Code. It is also available to the SEC, Faculty Councils and committees, and senators for assistance in drafting proposed legislation. The committee may also render advisory opinions and interpretations of the Faculty Code and may be consulted on the meaning and status of existing University rules and regulations (see Faculty Code, Sections 22-61 and 29-33.E).

1776-019,"Evans, Brock, 1937-",Oral history interview with Brock Evans,"Brock Evans' career as a leader in the environmental movement began in the mid-1960's. He has held prominent positions in numerous environmental organizations. Evans represents the branch of the movement that believes in achieving environmental goals by changing government policy through political give and take, litigation, and legislative lobbying. Â¶ Evans served as the Northwest representative of the Sierra Club and of the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs from 1967 to 1973, as acting director and director of the Washington D.C. office of the Sierra Club from 1973 to 1981, and as vice president for national issues for the National Audubon Society from 1981 to 1996. Evans also was the Audubon representative to the Ancient Forest Alliance circa 1988 to 1994. He also served on the board of a number of other environmental organizations, including the League of Conservation Voters and the Environmental Law Institute and the North Cascades Conservation Council. Most recently he has served as President of the Endangered Species Coalition Â¶ Born in 1937 in Columbus, Ohio, Evans earned his B.A. from Princeton in 1959. He spent two years in the U.S. Marine Corps and then earned his law degree at the University of Michigan while serving in the reserve of the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1963 Evans moved to Seattle and worked in a private law practice until his career changed course in the late 1960's. In 1966 while hiking in one of his favorite areas Evans encountered signs indicating that the ancient trees there were about to be logged. Infuriated by the impending loss of this forest, he left his private law practice and dedicated himself full-time to fighting environmental destruction. Â¶ Within very little time, Evans established himself as one of the leading environmentalists in the Pacific Northwest. From 1967 to 1973 he was the Northwest Representative for the Sierra Club and represented the Audubon Society through the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. As the Sierra Club Representative, he also was a co-founder of the Washington Environmental Council in 1968. During this time He became heavily active in state and regional environmental issues during this time. He organized citizen support and was the primary lobbyist in Washington State during the final crucial years when legislation was being formulated to establish North Cascades National Park. He led efforts to ensure that key parcels were included in the Pasayten and Glacier Peak Wilderness areas. His efforts led to renewed strength for campaigns to gain wilderness protection for the Alpine Lakes and other unprotected regions in the Cascades. In 1972 he received the Environmentalist of the Year award from the Washington Environmental Council. Â¶ In 1973, Evans moved into the national arena when he was named Director of the Sierra Club's Washington, D.C. office. In this position he lobbied Congress as well as administrative agencies, state and local governments, and other organizations on a wide range of environmental issues. Preserving Hell's Canyon was one of the major issues during his time at the Sierra Club. Private and public utility companies had wanted to dam this 100 mile stretch of Idaho's Snake River for over two decades, but had been unable to do so because of disputes about who would build and control the dam. In the 1970's, these energy interests came together and appeared able and willing to cooperate enough to undertake the project, but Evans set a historic precedent by filing the first environmental lawsuit in the Northwest against the dams. Then he, along with other environmentalists, successfully lobbied for federal legislation in 1975 that prevented any dam construction, legislation that Evans drafted himself. Â¶ During his time with the Sierra Club, Evans continued to gain a higher profile and a reputation as an outstanding lobbyist and leader. In 1977, U.S. News and World Report named him one of the most influential lobbyists in Washington, D.C., as did Fortune in 1982, showing not only his own strength, but the lobbying strength and legitimacy that environmentalists had gained. During this time he also served on the Environmental Advisory Board of the Army Corps of Engineers. Â¶ In 1981, Evans became the National Audubon Society's Vice-President for National Issues where he remained until 1996. During his career with the Audubon Society, the preservation of old growth forests in the Pacific Northwest was a major focus for Evans, as it had been throughout his career as an environmental advocate. Evans feared that timber companies were logging old growth forests too quickly and that the nation's ancient forests would soon be gone if nothing were changed. He believed that the ancient forest ecosystem could not be preserved by clear cutting patches of trees, as the Forest Service allowed timber companies to do. Â¶ Many of Evans's efforts to save ancient forests involved lobbying Congress, which had the power to change Forest Service policies and increase or limit logging in specific areas. In the mid 1980's, Evans and the Audubon Society directed much of their lobbying efforts toward Congressional appropriations committees, but met with only limited success. Evans and the Audubon Society then changed their strategy and teamed up with other environmental organizations to form the Ancient Forest Alliance. One of the coalition's new strategies involved focusing on the enforcement of existing laws to preserve forests, and the spotted owl soon became a central component of this strategy. The number of spotted owls was declining significantly because of logging in old growth forests. Environmentalists and biologists believed that the spotted owl was a \""management indicator species\"" and that its fortune was an indicator of the entire group of species in the old growth forests. For people such as Evans, the demise of this animal bolstered their belief in the importance of preserving the ancient forest ecosystem, but the owl's demise also gave them a new opportunity to prevent future logging. Because of the federal Endangered Species Act, which mandated the preservation of ecosystems that supported endangered species, classifying the owl as endangered would prevent logging in areas where they existed. However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was reluctant to list the owl as endangered, which Evans and others alleged was a result of timber industry influence and not because of scientific research. Because of environmentalists' litigious efforts, the federal courts in 1990 forced the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the spotted owl as \""threatened\"" and issued an injunction forbidding further habitatae destruction. These decisions were major victories for environmentalists and ended logging in many areas of ancient forests where spotted owls were believed to live. Â¶ Despite this victory, political battles over ancient forests continued between environmentalists and logging interests. Evans and others tried to press for more protected areas while logging interests tried to portray environmentalists as people who cared more about spotted owls than about loggers and the communities that depended on the timber industry. In 1993, the newly elected president Bill Clinton called a forest summit in Portland, Oregon to try to find compromise between logging interest and environmentalists. As a leader of one of the largest environmental organizations, Evans participated in the summit. Â¶ Another major issue for Evans during his time with the Audubon Society was the preservation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), located along the northern coast of Alaska. In the late 1980's, oil interest believed that there might be huge oil reserves in the Refuge but needed special legislation to open it to drilling. In 1989, a bill to allow drilling in the ANWR was about to pass through Congress when it suddenly was shelved because of the anti-oil backlash after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Nonetheless, legislation to open the refuge continued to surface in the early 1990's, but Evans, along with other environmentalists, was able to block its passage through Congress. After 1992, bills to open the refuge did pass through Congress on more than one occasion, but with President Clinton sure to veto such legislation, Evans and other environmentalists gave the issue less attention. Â¶ Throughout most of his environmental career, Evans took a pragmatic approach to conservation and at times received harsh criticism from those who said he was willing to compromise. This tension was often evident between local grassroots organizations, including chapters of the Audubon Society, and D.C.-based groups such as the Sierra Club and Audubon offices that Evans helped guide. However, on at least on occasion, Evans took a militant stance when he, along with a former U.S. Representative, Jim Jontz, and other environmental activists, was arrested in 1995 for blocking a logging road in Oregon's Siskiyou National Forest. Evans was protesting what was known as the \""Salvage Rider\"" that allowed tree cutting but had passed into law only because it was attached to an important piece of unrelated legislation. Â¶ During his time with the Audubon Society, Evans continued to undertake many activities both related and unrelated to the society's work. In 1984, he ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives from Washington's first congressional district. In the mid 1980's, he helped found and served on the Board of Directors of the Coast Alliance, an organization that tried to influence the government's coastal zone management plans. From 1985 until 1991, Evans was the Washington, D.C. representative of the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, and from 1989 to 1991 was on the Board of Directors of the Boundary Waters Wilderness Foundation. The Foundation raised funds and tried to expand the Boundary Waters Wilderness, as well as outlaw the use of motor vehicles for portaging. Throughout much of the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's, Evans was on the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation voters and chaired its Political Strategy Committee. For the League, Evans helped review and choose political candidates for the group's endorsements. From 1989 to 1994, he was also on the Board of Directors of the Environmental Law Institute, a think tank for members of the American Environmental Bar. Evans also was a board member for RESTORE: The North Woods, a grassroots organization that pushed for forestland protection in the North Woods eco region (a region extending over the northern tier of states from Maine to Minnesota). He also served on the Steering Committee of the Environmental Coalition for North America in the late l980's. Â¶ The overlapping issues of race and the environmental activism surfaced many times during Evans's career. From 1984 to 1991 he was a board member for the Human Environment Center, an organization that tried to bridge the gap between mostly white, middle-class environmentalists, and underprivileged minorities who typically had little involvement in the movement. The Center focused largely on the environmental problems of the cities, especially those that affected mostly poor minority groups, and tried to get minorities more involved in environmental issues. In the early 1990's, the issue of race and environment again took center stage when Evans helped found the Green Wave Movement. The Movement's goal was \""to restore American life and the American continent\"" and creates \""the foundation of a new green society based on the principles of environmental justice and a sustainable economy.\"" However, the group became divided over internal issues, mostly focusing on the homogeneity of its leaders, which critics believed was paradigmatic of the environmental movement as a whole. For Evans, it was a difficult and frustrating experience and he stepped down from the Steering Committee to open a position for someone other than a white male. Â¶ After retiring as Vice-President for the Audubon Society in 1996, Evans remained in Washington, D.C. as a lobbying consultant and in this capacity has continued working for environmental groups. In 1997 Evans became President of the Endangered Species Coalition in Washington, D.C. The Coalition is an association of 450 environmental, scientific, and religious groups dedicated to protecting and strengthening the Endangered Species Act. Â¶ "

1732-012,North Cascades Conservation Council,North Cascades Conservation Council records,"The North Cascades Conservation Council (NCCC) was organized in 1957 with the mission \""to protect and preserve the North Cascades' scenic, scientific, recreational, educational, and wilderness values.\"" For the next ten years, NCCC was dedicated to its main goal, the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. It was aided by other organizations dedicated to conservation, such as the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. Â¶ Conservation efforts targeting the North Cascades did not begin with NCCC. Concerns about the area were voiced as early as 1892, when a park proposal for Lake Chelan was presented but denounced as being against public interests. In 1937, the first formal proposal for a North Cascades National Park was submitted by the U.S. National Park Service and Owen A. Tomlinson. The proposal was impeded by opposition from the U.S. Forest Service, which had recently lost the battle over the formation of Olympic National Park. Â¶ In the mid-1950s, Grant McConnell, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focused on public land policy, raised the call for an organization to protect the North Cascades. Disturbed by the U.S. Forest Service's plans for timber sales, mining, and construction of a cross-mountain highway over Cascade Pass, McConnell convinced Polly Dyer to call a meeting at her home to discuss the threats to the North Cascades wilderness. McConnell's main objective was the formation of a single-issue conservation group dedicated to the North Cascades. Meeting attendees resisted McConnell's plan, citing the work being done on the issue by the Mountaineers Conservation Division, to which many attendees belonged. The Mountaineers Glacier Peak Subcommitee, chaired by Philip Zalesky, was also praised for its concentration on an important geographic area of the North Cascades. After the meeting, McConnell and other Sierra Club members worked to persuade North Cascades conservation leaders to form an organization. Patrick Goldsworthy was one of those leaders, and he later became the long-time president of NCCC. Â¶ Goldsworthy had proven himself to be a committed Northwest conservationist in the early 1950s. After moving to Seattle in 1952 to accept a research appointment in the University of Washington School of Medicine, he joined the Mountaineers Conservation Division and met John and Polly Dyer. Goldsworthy, together with his wife, Jane, and the Dyers, established the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club in 1954. Â¶ On March 23, 1957, during a Glacier Peak conference in Portland, Oregon, Goldsworthy and others took up the call to protect the North Cascades. Twenty-six people from Washington, Oregon, and California were present for the formation of the North Cascades Conservation Council. NCCC designated its immediate goal as the formation of the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area. Bylaws were written and officers were elected. Philip Zalesky served as president, Pat Goldsworthy as first vice-president, Una Davies as second vice-president, Polly Dyer as secretary, and Yvonne Prater as treasurer. Harvey Manning later joined the group as editor of the NCCC's newsletter. Â¶ With Patrick Goldsworthy serving as leader of both NCCC and the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club, assistance from the national Sierra Club and its executive director, David Brower, was quickly forthcoming. The Sierra Club had begun leading its first outing trips into the North Cascades a year earlier. In 1957, the Sierra Club produced the film, The Wilderness Alps of Stehekin. Publicizing the cause of the North Cascades, the film was shown extensively by the NCCC and other conservation groups. It was also circulated to public officials and members of Congress. Â¶ The Sierra Club furthered its commitment to the Pacific Northwest in 1961 by hiring Michael McCloskey, the first Northwest Conservation representative. The representative was funded by the Federation of the Western Outdoor Clubs and served as a valuable lobbyist and advocate for the formation of national parks and wilderness areas in the Northwest. Â¶ By 1959, support for a North Cascades National Park was strong among conservation organizations, including the NCCC, the National Parks Association, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Cascadians. Conservationists called for the U.S. Forest Service to suspend its plans for timber sales and road construction, and to allow the U.S. National Park Service to conduct a study of the possible park area. Washington Congressman Thomas Pelly, a vocal advocate of conservation, asked the U.S. National Park Service to conduct the study, only to be reprimanded by the director of the U.S. Forest Service for neglecting to ask for permission. Congressman Pelly, with the assistance of the Interior Department and groups such as the NCCC, then attempted to introduce legislation to order the study, but was unsuccessful. Â¶ In 1961, Pelly was presented with a petition bearing 22,000 signatures in favor of a park study. That same year, Washington Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson also joined the debate when they encouraged Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman to develop a forest management plan for the contested areas. Freeman imposed a temporary moratorium on logging, which ended the following year, only to be asked by Pelly to impose a stricter moratorium on logging until a national park study was held. Freeman denied the request, since the U.S. Forest Service had completed a high mountain management policy for the North Cascades. Â¶ In 1963, after disputes between the U.S. Park and Forest Services were settled, a joint study of the North Cascades was announced. The study was recommended by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, and the study team was chaired by the director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Edward C. Crafts. Public hearings to introduce the study were held in Seattle, Wenatchee, and Mount Vernon. The NCCC worked diligently to ensure a majority of oral and written statements in support of park establishment. The NCCC also submitted a comprehensive 120-page plan for the park, entitled Prospectus for a North Cascades National Park. The Prospectus confirmed the NCCC's leadership in the park campaign. Â¶ The study team's report, The North Cascades, was published in October 1965, recommending the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. The Sierra Club published the influential book, The Wild Cascades: Forgotten Parkland, in 1965 as well, to draw further attention to the area. Public hearings were held in 1966 to discuss the study team's findings. On March 20, 1967, Senators Jackson and Magnuson introduced Senate Bill 1321, which established the North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The bill was passed in November, and the following year, in October 1968, the North Cascades National Park Service Complex was created by an act of Congress. Â¶ Another long struggle to which the NCCC was committed was passing the Wilderness Act. The legislative effort began in 1956 as a wilderness bill drafted by Howard Zahniser, director of the Wilderness Society. The bill called for the conservation of the nation's remaining wilderness. Despite initial opposition and numerous revisions, the Wilderness Act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. The act created the National Wilderness Preservation System and put 9.1 million acres of national forest land into the new system. It was the first wilderness protection legislation passed in the world. Â¶ The first major crisis to occur under the Wilderness Act began in 1967 with Kennecott Copper Corporation's plan to create an open-pit mine in Miners Ridge, a location inside the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area and close to Image Lake. Since Kennecott owned the mineral rights to the land, the Wilderness Act's clause regarding private ownership seemed to protect the mine's development. Under pressure from tremendous publicity and opposition by the NCCC and Washington congressmen, Kennecott decided to postpone its plans, although talk of commencing mining operations resumed in 1969 when copper prices soared. The land was later bought from Kennecott and the area protected from commercial interests. Â¶ The NCCC also participated in the debate over roadways in national parks. The Park Service program launched Mission 66 in 1956 to improve deteriorating and dangerous conditions in the national parks that largely resulted from a massive boom in visitors after World War II. Mission 66 expanded visitor capacity in the national parks to accommodate an estimated eighty million automobile tourists within ten years. The program called for adding more overnight accommodations, building visitor centers, and constructing park roads. The roadway debate continued in 1957, when the Washington State legislature authorized a survey for a cross-Cascades highway. On September 2, 1972, the highway, known as the North Cascades Highway, officially opened, to the dismay of NCCC members. Another debate began in 1961 regarding the Outdoor Advertising Act, which established billboard control along scenic highways. The NCCC called for more aggressive controls and restrictions of outdoor advertising than the controversial act established in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the Northwest. Â¶ Over the past third of a century, the NCCC has accomplished much in conservation, including the creation of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Glacier Peak Wilderness, William O. Douglas Wilderness (Cougar Lakes Wilderness Area), Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Mt. Baker Wilderness, Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, and others. The NCCC has also collaborated with British Columbia allies to block the raising of Ross Dam and to encourage the establishment of a U.S.-Canadian international park. In addition, the NCCC newsletter, The Wild Cascades, has kept its members and other conservationists informed of and dedicated to the various issues affecting the North Cascades. The North Cascades Conservation Council has been a leader in the protection and preservation of the North Cascades mountain range from the Columbia River to the U.S.-Canadian border. Â¶ "

It was the family's trips to China and Japan that began both Fuller and his mother's passion for Asian antiquities. Richard Fuller graduated from the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania in 1915 and attended Yale before dropping out in 1917 to volunteer as an ambulance driver in France during World War I. Â¶ In 1919, the Fuller family traveled to Yokohama where Fuller and his mother purchased a number of jades and other Asian antiquities, which would later be included in the Seattle Art Museum's collection.

Fuller earned his second bachelor's degree in geology in 1924 and his master's degree in 1926 at the University of Washington where he later taught as a part time geology professor. Â¶ In 1928, Fuller joined the board of directors of the Seattle Fine Arts Society, where he, Horace C. Henry, and others amassed a small collection. The Seattle Fine Arts Society held exhibitions and lectures, while supporting local artists. Richard Fuller was elected president of the Seattle Fine Arts Society board in 1930. He submitted a proposal for the city of Seattle to construct a museum to house the Seattle Fine Arts Society's collection. The city accepted and Carl Gould, founder of the University of Washington School of Architecture, was hired to design the building. An architectural model of the museum was presented at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, and Richard Fuller and his mother Margaret Fuller presented the completed building to the city on June 29, 1933. Â¶ Richard Fuller was the Seattle Art Museum's founding director and served as director for the next 40 years, though never drew a salary for the position. In addition to establishing the Seattle Art Museum as recognizing the value of Asian art early on, Richard also was a generous supporter of local artists. Richard's patronage included works by Morris Graves, Mark Tobey, Kenneth Callahan, and William Cumming. Â¶ Richard Fuller took on leadership roles nationwide, including being president of the Western Association of Art Museum Directors, president of the National Association of Art Directors, and was a member of the International Council of Museums.

0001-002,Port Blakely Mill Company,Port Blakely Mill Company records,"Lumber mill.Â¶ At its height, the Port Blakely Mill Company was the largest on the Pacific Coast, and possibly in the entire world. Captain William Renton founded it in 1863 on Bainbridge Island, directly across from Seattle in the Puget Sound. Within a year the mill was turning out 50,000 board feet a day. The PBMCo expanded rapidly, as did the timber industry in Washington territory generally. (In the 1880s, the territory's annual timber production soared from 160 million board feet to over a billion). Although the California market was the most crucial, the PBMCo shipped its lumber throughout the Pacific Rim. The PBMCo briefly tried to enter the European market, but the long voyage around South America posed too great of a logistical challenge for consistent shipments to Europe. Â¶ In 1876, Renton incorporated the company in San Francisco with new partner Charles S. Holmes. Prior to 1885, the PBMCo obtained all its logs by contract with independent operators, since Renton did not want to take on either the additional risk or capital investment of logging camps. The decreasing supply of accessible high-quality lumber and the steady inflation in log prices led him to change his policy. He noted in 1864 that timber \""contiguous to the Sound is nearly exhausted.\"" The company purchased land north of Olympia, and constructed the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor Railroad to transport the logs. By 1891, the company held 80,000 acres of timber land. A fire destroyed the mill in 1888, but a new one, larger and more efficient, was in operation within the year. Â¶ The PBMCo would face other stiff challenges in the 1890s, and would do so without the guidance of Renton, who died in 1891. A devastating depression swept the United States in 1893, forcing the company to operate in a hostile economic climate. It also faced increased competition from eastern mills moving into the Pacific Northwest. The St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company managed to rival PBMCo's position as the largest mill in the region during the 1890s. Weyerhaeuser entered the region in 1900, purchasing 900,000 acres of timberland. The PBMCo became increasingly ill-suited for competition with firms better located for participation in the rail and cargo trades. Â¶ In February 1903 Renton's heirs sold the company to two men from Michigan, David E. Skinner and John W. Eddy. The mill burned again in 1907, and the one built to replace it was much smaller. By 1912, the new mill operated only sporadically. Demands generated by the First World War temporarily returned the mill's economic viability; after the war, the demand crashed, and so did the mill's brief economic resurgence. Eddy and Skinner closed it in 1922 and divided the PBMCo's assets. The defunct mill was dismantled in 1924. Eddy bought out Skinner in that same year, and from that point forward the PBMCo relied upon its timber holdings and was exclusively an Eddy family concern. Â¶ "

Throughout its history, the organization has also focused on other issues related to carbon pollution, clean energy, water pollution, forests, and public lands.Â¶ In 1986 and 1987, the WEC was heavily involved with the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Implementation Project, which was the result of negotiations between the timber industry, the four natural resource agencies in Washington State, Indian tribes, and environmentalists. The Project is a cooperative plan for managing forest harvest practices on both state and private timberlands. Marcy Golde was involved with the negotiations, while Lisa Lombardy served as the WEC's statewide coordinator. Other WEC staff, through private funding, monitored timber harvest applications.Â¶ Another major legal case in which the WEC was involved concerned Washington State rules that imposed requirements on the design, equipment, reporting, and operations of oil tankers.

For each program reviewed the assessment process is one of peer review, with review teams individually assembled from UW faculty and from the faculty of other leading research-intensive universities. Â¶ Program review is a primary activity of the Graduate School Council. The Graduate School Council is an elected body of graduate faculty that advises the dean on graduate program policies and graduate education issues. The Council's activities are coordinated by the Office of Academic Programs. The Office also oversees graduate program policies published as Graduate School Memoranda.

The Henry Art Gallery is a nationally-recognized center for the exploration of visual culture and is the Pacific Northwest's premier modern and contemporary art museum. The museum's exhibitions bring important works of art to Seattle from throughout the world and bring into public view works of art from the Northwest. These exhibitions and their related programs invite dialogue about contemporary culture, politics, aesthetics and the traditions of visual art and design of the last two centuries. Exhibitions at the Henry frequently present recent or newly commissioned work of visually and conceptually challenging artists such as Ann Hamilton (1992), Gary Hill (1994), Kara Walker (1998), Roni Horn (1998), Leone & Macdonald (1999), Josiah McElheny (1998), Jennifer Steinkamp (1999), IÃ±igo Manglano-Ovalle (2000) and Tony Oursler (2000). The museum also hosts nationally and internationally touring exhibitions such as Deep Storage, The Arsenal of Memory (1998), Thinking Print (1998), Inside Out: New Chinese Art (1999-2000) and Andy Warhol: Drawings, 1942-1987 (July 20 - October 8, 2000). Â¶ The museum's major renovation and expansion, completed in April 1997, quadrupled the museum's size - from 10,000 square feet to over 40,000 square feet. Increased size allowed for the addition of a 154-seat auditorium, a multi-media gallery, cafÃ©, bookstore and sculpture court along with improved facilities for art handling and storage and collections research. An architectural collage of glass, textured stainless steel and cast stone, designed by Charles Gwathmey, compliments the original red brick collegiate-Gothic structure designed by Carl Gould in the 1920s.

1908-003,"Andrews, Emery E., 1894-1976",Emery E. Andrews papers,"Emery E. Andrews was an esteemed pastor at Seattle's Japanese Baptist Church who devoted the bulk of his adult life to ministering to Japanese communities in Washington State, the U.S., and Japan. Born July 29, 1894, in Albion, Nebraska, \""Andy\"" moved with his family at age two to a farm outside Modesto, California. At age ten he became a member of his local First Baptist Church and was licensed to preach at age 19, one year before he graduated from high school. For the next three years he pursued theological training at the Bible Institute of Los Angeles and in 1916 was married to Mary Brooks in Orting, Washington, a small town in the foothills of Mt. Rainier. In 1917, he was ordained to the ministry by his home church in Modesto, California. There, he worked among the local Italian and Mexican communities while attending Los Angeles Junior College. Â¶ In 1919, he and his wife and infant daughter moved to Seattle, where Reverend Andrews worked at the Cosmopolitan Mission while attending the University of Washington. After receiving a B.A. in Sociology in 1922 and a Five-year Teaching Diploma in 1929, Rev. Andrews became pastor to the Nisei community at the Japanese Baptist Church. He received his second B.A., in Education, from the University of Washington in 1931. Â¶ The start of the War in the Pacific in late 1941 -- and the subsequent, rapid forced removal of tens of thousands of persons of Japanese descent to incarceration centers throughout the West in 1942 -- was a major turning point in Rev. Andrews's ministry and life. The entire congregation that he served for thirteen years suddenly absent, Rev. Andrews made almost daily visits to the Camp Harmony Assembly Center in Puyallup, Washington. When inmates were transferred to the Minidoka relocation center in Hunt, Idaho, in September 1942, Rev. Andrews and his family moved to the nearby town of Twin Falls so that he could continue to minister to the Japanese. There, he leased a home much larger than his family needed in order to provide a stopping-off place for Japanese going to and from the center (an average of 167 Japanese visited the house every month). In addition, from 1942-1945, he made fifty-six trips from Twin Falls -- covering 1,500 miles each time -- to retrieve cars and other goods stored for Japanese Americans at the Japanese Baptist Church in Seattle. He also traveled extensively to other incarceration centers. Â¶ Rev. Andrews' commitment to Japanese Americans during World War II involved extraordinary personal sacrifices and risks. Because of his association with the inmates at Minidoka, he was refused service in a Twin Falls cafe. Several months later the cafe owner purchased the house Rev. Andrews had leased and ordered him to move. He was also, for a brief time, the subject of an F.B.I. investigation. Â¶ In January 1945, he and his family returned to their farm near Seattle and reopened the Japanese Baptist Church the following year. Rev. Andrews spent the summers of 1949 and 1951 as a volunteer for \""Houses of Hiroshima,\"" a private relief organization formed by pacifist/writer Floyd Schmoe to rebuild homes for victims of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Â¶ Rev. Andrews resigned as pastor of the church in December 1955 and was asked at that time to continue as the Minister of Visitation. He retired in 1959 and was named Pastor Emeritus. In 1970, the Emperor of Japan awarded Rev. Andrews the Fifth Order of the Sacred Treasure. He died of a heart attack in 1976 at the age of 81. Â¶ "
0036-003,"Bagley, Clarence, 1843-1932","Clarence Bagley papers, undated photostats of 1863 originals","From his arrival in Seattle in 1860 until his death in 1932 at the age of eighty-eight, Clarence Bagley was concerned with the growth of Washington as a Territory and State in general, and Seattle's growth as a city in particular. Soon after their arrival and his father's appointment as University Commissioner, Bagley became a clerk in the Surveyor General's office in 1866, shortly after his marriage to Alice Mercer. Â¶ This move brought him directly into politics and into the printing trade as well. While working in the Surveyor General's office in Olympia, Bagley came under the tutelage of Randall Hewitt, owner of the Territorial Republican and the Temperance Echo. With L. G. Abbott he bought the Echo in 1868 but sold his interest shortly thereafter and took employment with the Commercial Age, organ of the Republican Party. When this newspaper was discontinued in 1870, he returned to Seattle, remaining until May 1871, when he became deputy in the internal revenue office, holding the position until 1873. While in this office he worked with the Puget Sound Courier, finally buying it in 1873, and emerging as Territorial Printer for the next ten years. He sold the Courier and the printing office in 1884, returning to Seattle to stay in 1885 after a brief interval in Portland as a deputy collector of internal revenue. Â¶ By now a confirmed publisher, Clarence Bagley joined with others and purchased the Post-Intelligencer in 1886, which he managed until L. S. J. Hunt took it over that same year. Other ephemeral ventures followed, one in banking and one again in newspapers, joining with Homer Hill for two years in publishing the Daily Press. Â¶ In 1890 he was elected to the House of Delegates of the City Council from where he fought open gambling and Seattle's \""open town\"" policy with the result that doors were barred on many of the \""gambling hells. \"" Following upon this experience in elective office he acted as an adviser in writing the 1893 city charter, contributing clauses affecting assessments for local improvements. Â¶ From 1893 until his appointment as Secretary of the Board of Public Works in 1900, he worked in the City Comptroller's office. He continued as Secretary of the Board until his retirement in 1929. These experiences in city government and his ever-present concern for governmental efficiency led him to become candidate in 1909 for the Republican nomination for councilman from the Eighth Ward. He announced his candidacy in letters to friends, but did not actively canvass his ward for votes. He stressed his alarm with what, in his opinion, was a growing trend toward mismanagement and extravagance in city affairs. Promising a \""square deal, \"" Bagley felt this could be changed with a business-like economy and management terminating in better, cleaner government. Â¶ The election itself, with its many side issues, was unsettling for him as he associated political reporting with what he considered to be honestly partisan, and took exception to the methods used by 1910 newspapermen, not only in his own case but on behalf of all the candidates. He lost the election to Elbert F. Blaine, and explained that the loss was due to his association with the \""City Hall Gang, \"" whom the voters had rejected completely. Â¶ Until this point in his career, he appears to have been a public servant first and a historian second. Now his interest in historical writing resurfaced. He had begun two years previously to edit the manuscripts of William I. Marshall's Acquisition of Oregon. Marshall, whom Bagley had met in 1905, had devoted twenty years to disproving the \""Whitman Saved Oregon\"" myth, and after his death in 1906, Bagley and Thompson Coit Elliott, both interested in seeing the work published, joined to edit the manuscript and to assist the widow financially. Â¶ Despite feeling that his position with the Board of Public Works took too much time away from historical study, he stayed on as Secretary, editing Marshall's work for publication in his spare time; it appeared in 1911. This was followed by publication of articles in historical quarterlies and journals, and in 1916, The History of Seattle appeared, culminating more than two years of research. Â¶ With publication of this work, Clarence Bagley's often-expressed dream of writing the history of his region was becoming a reality. He had little sympathy for writers who romanticized the facts of history into fiction that bore little or no resemblance to actuality. However, his view of \""actuality\"" was restricted by rigid adherence to the \""pioneer code\"" on the one hand and self-imposed limitations on the other, as he illustrated in a letter to Edmond S. Meany in 1911: Â¶ \""Sometime I shall write a history of Seattle, and while what I shall say will be the truth I shall not give all the truth. I shall rake up no old stories of evil. \"" Â¶ His activities were not confined to writing. He gave his time freely in efforts to organize pioneer societies and similar groups, frequently being called upon for speeches and public appearances in connection with pioneer-inspired celebrations. Â¶ In 1905 he had become deeply involved in a dispute between the historical societies of Seattle and Tacoma. Consolidation of effort and location under the aegis of the State was suggested by the Seattle group when its members (including Meany, Cornelius Hanford, Thomas Burke, Roger S. Greene and John P. Hoyt) decided that the Tacoma society was \""dead. \"" Most of the members of the Seattle group had aided in founding the Washington State Historical Society in 1891. But the early years turned into a struggle for mere existence which Bagley et al regarded as a hindrance to accomplishment of the Society's original purposes of collection and preservation of historical source materials. This suggestion revitalized the slumbering rivalry of the two cities and the battle was joined. Bagley became the unofficial spokesman for the Washington University State Historical Society which had been newly founded. In a letter to Professor J.N. Bowman of the State Normal School in Bellingham, he explained: Â¶ \""Experience had proved that the Societies thus allied with State Universities have done the best work, and that this will be true here.\"" Â¶ Proposals of merger were not accepted by Tacoma, and the Washington State Historical Society remained a separate body. Unallied with the Tacoma group in either effort or ideals, Bagley was elected president of the Washington University State Historical Society, and under his leadership the work of collecting and preserving original data was begun. His vision of a central repository for historical research materials was challenged once again in 1915, when the King County Historical Society sought allocation of land on University-owned property. Â¶ In a letter to Winlock W. Miller of Seattle, Bagley called for a \""concert of action in historical efforts, \"" insisting that \""I have seen so many similar efforts live a precarious existence and finally die from slow decay that I may be permitted to express doubts as to the long life or active work of the present one.\"" Â¶ In the public mind Bagley symbolized Pacific Northwest history in many ways. The post-office delivered letters to him addressed merely \""Historian, Seattle, Washington;\"" newspapers of the city began to refer to him affectionately as \""Pop, \"" and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce directed all of its inquiries on historical matters to his desk in City Hall. Â¶ In 1929 he brought out his History of King County. With retirement, articles and pamphlets began to appear with regularity. Indian Myths of the Northwest, \""compiled, annotated and expurgated\"" as he wrote to a friend, was published in 1930. Â¶ Plans for future publications simmered. Clarence Bagley began 1932 with letters to friends expressing enthusiasm for his many historical projects, and often a small boast regarding his health. He was proud of the two-mile walk he took each day from his home on Seattle's Queen Anne hill \""to town, rain or shine. \"" But a lingering cold developed into pneumonia, and on February 17, 1932, \""Pop\"" Bagley died.

1930-019,Young Women's Christian Association (University of Washington),Young Women's Christian Association (University of Washington) records,"The University of Washington Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) was established in 1895 by Ella Chamberlain, head of the English department. It was the first women's organization on campus and was organized before the incorporation of the national YWCA in 1906. In its early years, the UW YWCA was mostly a religious organization, offering Bible study groups, and devotional and missionary meetings. Throughout the 1910s, members volunteered to perform mission work and teach English to Japanese immigrants in local settlement houses. In 1916 the tenth anniversary of the national YWCA's founding was celebrated through the national jubilee. Â¶ In 1930 after the State Legislature prohibited religious organizations from being housed on the University campus, the UW YWCA moved off campus. In 1940 it merged with the UW YMCA and the two organizations operated jointly for the next thirty years . The UW YMCA-YWCA were housed in Eagleson Hall from 1940 to 1964. Eagleson Hall was sold to the University of Washington in 1964, and a new, spacious building was completed in 1965 at 4525 19th Ave. N.E. Â¶ In 1962 UW denied a campus group space for a talk by Gus Hall, general secretary of the American Communist Party. Students petitioned the UW YMCA-YWCA for rental use of Eagleson Hall, which was granted after much debate. The decision to allow a Communist speaker use YMCA-YWCA resources sparked immediate outrage and support. Members of the general public, students, faculty, and other YMCA-YWCA executives voiced their opinions through phone calls, letters, and newspaper articles. Some believed in the upholding of freedom of speech ; others were outraged by the \""unAmerican\"" and \""un-Christian\"" nature of the Communist Party. The topic of Hall's speech was the McCarran Internal Security Act (1950), which required registration of Communist party members and attempted to criminalize the party. Elizabeth Jackson and Frank Mark, respective executive directors for the UW YMCA-YWCA, made the difficult decision to allow Hall a speaking platform. (Elizabeth Jackson later went on to head the Western Region of the National Student YWCA.) After the controversial event, the organizations drafted an open platform policy, affirming their commitment to freedom of speech and intellectual pursuit. Throughout the 1960s, speakers and forums were sponsored by the UW YMCA-YWCA on diverse topics such as LSD use, the beatnik or \""fringie\"" problem on University Way, capital punishment, racism, and birth control. Â¶ 1970 was a pivotal year for the UW YWCA, marking its declaration of autonomy from the YMCA and subsequent move to 4224 University Way N.E. The effects of the second wave of the women's movement can be seen in its motivation for independent status, namely its commitment to \""the development of a separate, visible identity of self-determining women-not identical to, but equal to men.\"" Over the course of a decade, the UW YWCA pioneered feminist programming, providing an extensive range of services and activities not only for UW students but also for women throughout the Seattle area. Many of the UW YWCA's programs were considered radical or controversial , and pushed the understanding of what a YWCA meant for women and a community. Â¶ The Abortion Birth Control (ABC) Referral Service was formed after a UW student group, the Committee for Abortion Reform , was ordered off campus for advocating passage of a 1970 abortion reform bill (Referendum 20) in Washington State. ABC found a home at the UW YWCA, disbanding as a politically-focused group and reforming as a support service. The ABC Referral Service provided doctor referrals, counseling and advocacy to women considering abortion procedures, as well as birth control methods, and a range of other reproductive health topics. ABC staff regularly visited the offices of doctors providing abortions and gathered information from abortion patients about their experiences to ensure the quality of their referrals. Â¶ Another UW YWCA program centered on women's health. Aradia Clinic opened in 1972 after a year of organizing. The clinic was built by over sixty women under the leadership of a female architect. Aradia strongly encouraged patients to take their health into their own hands. Aradia staff offered annual examinations, pregnancy detection and counselling , and other medical services, as well as self-health classes, workshops, and abortion procedures. In 1973, Aradia sponsored the Third World Women Family Planning Needs Assessment Project. Several community groups, including EI Centro de la Raza and Planned Parenthood, encouraged Aradia to research the need for family planning services within Seattle's ethnic communities. The project's objective was to determine what family planning services were needed and how those needs could be met. Information was gathered from family planning clinics, ethnic service centers, and a sampling of women from each community. The report was completed in 1974 and included extensive demographic material and a list of recommendations. In 1973, Aradia legally separated from the YWCA in order to release the Board of Directors from responsibility for Aradia's actions, although it continued to be housed in the UW YWCA building until 1978. As of 2005, it operates as the Aradia Women's Health Center, and has remained committed to providing feminist health care for women. Â¶ The Lesbian Resource Center began as the Gay Women's Resource Center in 1971 after a UW YWCA staff member took a course on homosexuality at the UW Experimental College and recognized a need in the community. The LRC was a peer counseling center that prpvidea support services to lesbians in the Seattle-King County area. As well as providing individual counseling , a lending library, and a speaker's bureau, discussion \""rap\"" groups were offered. The LRC also worked to make changes within the UW YWCA, pushing for more lesbian membership on the Board of Directors. The LRC became independent from the UW YWCA in 1980. It gained non-profit status under the name Pacific Women's Resources but continued to offer services as the LRC. As of 2005, the LRC is still active in Seattle. Â¶ Mechanica began as a women's co-operative garage and auto mechanics course in 1972. By 1975, it had evolved into a skilled trades information service for women seeking to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades and other nontraditional jobs. As well as providing job counseling , Mechanica staff promoted affirmative action hiring of women and ethnic minorities and pushed for affirmative action placements in union apprenticeships. They worked hard to persuade the University of Washington to adopt a 12% goal for women on UW construction sites. Off campus, Mechanica worked as a consultant to the City of Seattle and King County to help them reach affirmative action goals. It also worked with Federal Contract Compliance officers to push local private companies to hire women. Mechanica lost funding in1980, and the program was converted into a Women's Employment Service. Â¶ Women in Trades (WIT) emerged out of Mechanica as an advocacy group for equal employment opportunites for women and people of color in the trades. In operation by 1976, WIT was an organization of working women employed in bluecollar jobs in the production, maintenance, and construction industries. They were dedicated to establishing legal action for the enforcement of affirmative action goals on a local and national level. Together with Mechanica, WIT negotiated with the Port of Seattle and local unions to ensure they met affirmative action hiring guidelines. WIT also offered support groups and legal support for tradeswomen . WIT was defunct by 1979, but the annual Women in Trades Fair started by Mechanica in 1979 still continues. Â¶ Rape Relief was formed in 1972 following a speakout on rape on the UW campus. Rape Relief provided a 24-hour crisis line for victims of sexual assault and their allies, as well as medical and legal advocacy . Rape Relief staff promoted community education about rape by speaking to junior high and high school students, as well as to various adult community groups. Projects designed for developmentally disabled people, ethnic communities and non-English speaking victims were created. Rape Relief also conducted sensitivity training for police in Washington, Oregon and Alaska . Rape Relief became independent in 1980 and continued to operate as Seattle Rape Relief until financial problems forced its closure in 1999. Â¶ Serve Our Sisters (SOS) was formed in 1970 by two Seattle feminists and was modeled on a temporary, feminist, emergency housing service for women in crisis in New York City. In 1972, SOS became part of the UW YWCA, obtaining a much-needed central telephone. SOS provided women with housing, referrals, a telephone crisis line, and emotional support. Local referral agencies, such as the Open Door Clinic and Harborview Emergency Room, also used SOS's services. By 1974, SOS was no longer an active. Â¶ The Third World Women's Resource Center opened in the summer of 1973 as part of the UW YWCA's attempt to implement the One Imperative to Eliminate Racism. The One Imperative was a National YWCA policy which pushed for \""the elimination of racism wherever it exists and by any means necessary.\"" One of the main purposes of the Center was to provide educational material for all women struggling with the intersections of racism, sexism and economic oppression. The Center was developed and coordinated by Third World women, or women of color. Counseling, classes, rap groups, a library, a speaker's bureau, and a referral service were offered, and there were also efforts to interact with incarcerated women of color. The Center was no longer active by 1976. The failure of the UW YWCA to implement the One Imperative successfully caused tension among staff and Board members. Â¶ Women in Midstream (WI M) was started as the Ad-Hoc Committee on Menopause in 1972 by several middle-aged women who served on the Board of Directors and saw the need for a program dedicated to older women's health, particularly on the topic of menopause. WIM sent out questionnaires about women's personal experiences dealing with symptoms, treatments and the medical field. Due to a small amount of unexpected national publicity, women from around the United States participated and looked to WIM as a resource on menopause. A WIM volunteer, Jane Page wrote a book The Other Awkward Age utilizing the questionnaire results and contributing a much-needed woman's perspective on menopause. WIM was no longer in operation by 1979. Â¶ Women's Divorce Cooperative (WDC) began operating in 1971 as a cooperative of women interested in learning more about divorce law and how to file for divorce without hiring a lawyer. The WDC became an official UW YWCA program in 1975. In its early years, WDC volunteers provided sessions in pro se divorce procedures, as well as referrals to lawyers, counselors, and other agencies for further help in securing a divorce. Telephone and in-person counseling were also available to help women cope emotionally with a divorce. The WDC separated from the UW YWCA in 1980 to regain financial control and restore a cooperative philosophy. Â¶ The feminist spirit inherent in the UW YWCA's programming can also be seen in internal organizational changes. In the two years following its independence from the UW YMCA, the staff structure shifted from a hierarchical to a co-director model, in which three adminstrators received equal pay. The Co-Directorship was seen as a more egalitarian power structure. Evaluation of the model began in 1975, and in 1976, the Board of Directors voted to return to an Executive Coordinator model. The Executive Coordinator was responsible for agency supervision, staff development and supervision , fiscal management, liasion with the Board, and coordination with the community services. Many staff members were displeased with the restructuring; some did not feel included in the decision-making process and others did not believe the model fit into a feminist organiza tion. Â¶ In 1980, the UW YWCA was evicted from University Way and moved away from the UW campus to Northlake. They remained at 701 NE Northlake Way until 1988 and continued to \""struggle for peace and justice, freedom and dignity for all people ,\"" as stated by the National YWCA purpose. The UW YWCA was still active in 1995 on the UW campus, though they may have become defunct as early as 1996. Â¶ "

1930-001,Young Women's Christian Association (University of Washington),Young Women's Christian Association (University of Washington) records,"The University of Washington Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) was established in 1895 by Ella Chamberlain, head of the English department. It was the first women's organization on campus and was organized before the incorporation of the national YWCA in 1906. In its early years, the UW YWCA was mostly a religious organization, offering Bible study groups, and devotional and missionary meetings. Throughout the 1910s, members volunteered to perform mission work and teach English to Japanese immigrants in local settlement houses. In 1916 the tenth anniversary of the national YWCA's founding was celebrated through the national jubilee. Â¶ In 1930 after the State Legislature prohibited religious organizations from being housed on the University campus, the UW YWCA moved off campus. In 1940 it merged with the UW YMCA and the two organizations operated jointly for the next thirty years . The UW YMCA-YWCA were housed in Eagleson Hall from 1940 to 1964. Eagleson Hall was sold to the University of Washington in 1964, and a new, spacious building was completed in 1965 at 4525 19th Ave. N.E. Â¶ In 1962 UW denied a campus group space for a talk by Gus Hall, general secretary of the American Communist Party. Students petitioned the UW YMCA-YWCA for rental use of Eagleson Hall, which was granted after much debate. The decision to allow a Communist speaker use YMCA-YWCA resources sparked immediate outrage and support. Members of the general public, students, faculty, and other YMCA-YWCA executives voiced their opinions through phone calls, letters, and newspaper articles. Some believed in the upholding of freedom of speech ; others were outraged by the \""unAmerican\"" and \""un-Christian\"" nature of the Communist Party. The topic of Hall's speech was the McCarran Internal Security Act (1950), which required registration of Communist party members and attempted to criminalize the party. Elizabeth Jackson and Frank Mark, respective executive directors for the UW YMCA-YWCA, made the difficult decision to allow Hall a speaking platform. (Elizabeth Jackson later went on to head the Western Region of the National Student YWCA.) After the controversial event, the organizations drafted an open platform policy, affirming their commitment to freedom of speech and intellectual pursuit. Throughout the 1960s, speakers and forums were sponsored by the UW YMCA-YWCA on diverse topics such as LSD use, the beatnik or \""fringie\"" problem on University Way, capital punishment, racism, and birth control. Â¶ 1970 was a pivotal year for the UW YWCA, marking its declaration of autonomy from the YMCA and subsequent move to 4224 University Way N.E. The effects of the second wave of the women's movement can be seen in its motivation for independent status, namely its commitment to \""the development of a separate, visible identity of self-determining women-not identical to, but equal to men.\"" Over the course of a decade, the UW YWCA pioneered feminist programming, providing an extensive range of services and activities not only for UW students but also for women throughout the Seattle area. Many of the UW YWCA's programs were considered radical or controversial , and pushed the understanding of what a YWCA meant for women and a community. Â¶ The Abortion Birth Control (ABC) Referral Service was formed after a UW student group, the Committee for Abortion Reform , was ordered off campus for advocating passage of a 1970 abortion reform bill (Referendum 20) in Washington State. ABC found a home at the UW YWCA, disbanding as a politically-focused group and reforming as a support service. The ABC Referral Service provided doctor referrals, counseling and advocacy to women considering abortion procedures, as well as birth control methods, and a range of other reproductive health topics. ABC staff regularly visited the offices of doctors providing abortions and gathered information from abortion patients about their experiences to ensure the quality of their referrals. Â¶ Another UW YWCA program centered on women's health. Aradia Clinic opened in 1972 after a year of organizing. The clinic was built by over sixty women under the leadership of a female architect.

Among other achievements, the WEC has worked to enforce and pass the State Environmental Policy Act, the State Superfund Law, the Growth Management Act, and the Shoreline Management Act. It also operates the Environmental Priorities Coalition and the Voter Education Program. Throughout its history, the organization has also focused on other issues related to carbon pollution, clean energy, water pollution, forests, and public lands.Â¶ In 1986 and 1987, the WEC was heavily involved with the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Implementation Project, which was the result of negotiations between the timber industry, the four natural resource agencies in Washington State, Indian tribes, and environmentalists. The Project is a cooperative plan for managing forest harvest practices on both state and private timberlands.

0001-010,Port Blakely Mill Company,"\""Port Blakely Mill Company -- the Early Years\""","Lumber mill.Â¶ At its height, the Port Blakely Mill Company was the largest on the Pacific Coast, and possibly in the entire world. Captain William Renton founded it in 1863 on Bainbridge Island, directly across from Seattle in the Puget Sound. Within a year the mill was turning out 50,000 board feet a day. The PBMCo expanded rapidly, as did the timber industry in Washington territory generally. (In the 1880s, the territory's annual timber production soared from 160 million board feet to over a billion). Although the California market was the most crucial, the PBMCo shipped its lumber throughout the Pacific Rim. The PBMCo briefly tried to enter the European market, but the long voyage around South America posed too great of a logistical challenge for consistent shipments to Europe. Â¶ In 1876, Renton incorporated the company in San Francisco with new partner Charles S. Holmes. Prior to 1885, the PBMCo obtained all its logs by contract with independent operators, since Renton did not want to take on either the additional risk or capital investment of logging camps. The decreasing supply of accessible high-quality lumber and the steady inflation in log prices led him to change his policy. He noted in 1864 that timber \""contiguous to the Sound is nearly exhausted.\"" The company purchased land north of Olympia, and constructed the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor Railroad to transport the logs. By 1891, the company held 80,000 acres of timber land. A fire destroyed the mill in 1888, but a new one, larger and more efficient, was in operation within the year. Â¶ The PBMCo would face other stiff challenges in the 1890s, and would do so without the guidance of Renton, who died in 1891. A devastating depression swept the United States in 1893, forcing the company to operate in a hostile economic climate. It also faced increased competition from eastern mills moving into the Pacific Northwest. The St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company managed to rival PBMCo's position as the largest mill in the region during the 1890s. Weyerhaeuser entered the region in 1900, purchasing 900,000 acres of timberland. The PBMCo became increasingly ill-suited for competition with firms better located for participation in the rail and cargo trades. Â¶ In February 1903 Renton's heirs sold the company to two men from Michigan, David E. Skinner and John W. Eddy. The mill burned again in 1907, and the one built to replace it was much smaller. By 1912, the new mill operated only sporadically. Demands generated by the First World War temporarily returned the mill's economic viability; after the war, the demand crashed, and so did the mill's brief economic resurgence. Eddy and Skinner closed it in 1922 and divided the PBMCo's assets. The defunct mill was dismantled in 1924. Eddy bought out Skinner in that same year, and from that point forward the PBMCo relied upon its timber holdings and was exclusively an Eddy family concern. Â¶ "

It was aided by other organizations dedicated to conservation, such as the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. Â¶ Conservation efforts targeting the North Cascades did not begin with NCCC. Concerns about the area were voiced as early as 1892, when a park proposal for Lake Chelan was presented but denounced as being against public interests. In 1937, the first formal proposal for a North Cascades National Park was submitted by the U.S. National Park Service and Owen A. Tomlinson. The proposal was impeded by opposition from the U.S. Forest Service, which had recently lost the battle over the formation of Olympic National Park. Â¶ In the mid-1950s, Grant McConnell, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focused on public land policy, raised the call for an organization to protect the North Cascades. Disturbed by the U.S. Forest Service's plans for timber sales, mining, and construction of a cross-mountain highway over Cascade Pass, McConnell convinced Polly Dyer to call a meeting at her home to discuss the threats to the North Cascades wilderness. McConnell's main objective was the formation of a single-issue conservation group dedicated to the North Cascades. Meeting attendees resisted McConnell's plan, citing the work being done on the issue by the Mountaineers Conservation Division, to which many attendees belonged. The Mountaineers Glacier Peak Subcommitee, chaired by Philip Zalesky, was also praised for its concentration on an important geographic area of the North Cascades. After the meeting, McConnell and other Sierra Club members worked to persuade North Cascades conservation leaders to form an organization. Patrick Goldsworthy was one of those leaders, and he later became the long-time president of NCCC. Â¶ Goldsworthy had proven himself to be a committed Northwest conservationist in the early 1950s. After moving to Seattle in 1952 to accept a research appointment in the University of Washington School of Medicine, he joined the Mountaineers Conservation Division and met John and Polly Dyer. Goldsworthy, together with his wife, Jane, and the Dyers, established the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club in 1954. Â¶ On March 23, 1957, during a Glacier Peak conference in Portland, Oregon, Goldsworthy and others took up the call to protect the North Cascades. Twenty-six people from Washington, Oregon, and California were present for the formation of the North Cascades Conservation Council. NCCC designated its immediate goal as the formation of the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area. Bylaws were written and officers were elected. Philip Zalesky served as president, Pat Goldsworthy as first vice-president, Una Davies as second vice-president, Polly Dyer as secretary, and Yvonne Prater as treasurer. Harvey Manning later joined the group as editor of the NCCC's newsletter. Â¶ With Patrick Goldsworthy serving as leader of both NCCC and the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club, assistance from the national Sierra Club and its executive director, David Brower, was quickly forthcoming. The Sierra Club had begun leading its first outing trips into the North Cascades a year earlier. In 1957, the Sierra Club produced the film, The Wilderness Alps of Stehekin. Publicizing the cause of the North Cascades, the film was shown extensively by the NCCC and other conservation groups. It was also circulated to public officials and members of Congress. Â¶ The Sierra Club furthered its commitment to the Pacific Northwest in 1961 by hiring Michael McCloskey, the first Northwest Conservation representative. The representative was funded by the Federation of the Western Outdoor Clubs and served as a valuable lobbyist and advocate for the formation of national parks and wilderness areas in the Northwest. Â¶ By 1959, support for a North Cascades National Park was strong among conservation organizations, including the NCCC, the National Parks Association, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Cascadians. Conservationists called for the U.S. Forest Service to suspend its plans for timber sales and road construction, and to allow the U.S. National Park Service to conduct a study of the possible park area. Washington Congressman Thomas Pelly, a vocal advocate of conservation, asked the U.S. National Park Service to conduct the study, only to be reprimanded by the director of the U.S. Forest Service for neglecting to ask for permission. Congressman Pelly, with the assistance of the Interior Department and groups such as the NCCC, then attempted to introduce legislation to order the study, but was unsuccessful. Â¶ In 1961, Pelly was presented with a petition bearing 22,000 signatures in favor of a park study. That same year, Washington Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson also joined the debate when they encouraged Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman to develop a forest management plan for the contested areas. Freeman imposed a temporary moratorium on logging, which ended the following year, only to be asked by Pelly to impose a stricter moratorium on logging until a national park study was held. Freeman denied the request, since the U.S. Forest Service had completed a high mountain management policy for the North Cascades. Â¶ In 1963, after disputes between the U.S. Park and Forest Services were settled, a joint study of the North Cascades was announced. The study was recommended by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, and the study team was chaired by the director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Edward C. Crafts. Public hearings to introduce the study were held in Seattle, Wenatchee, and Mount Vernon. The NCCC worked diligently to ensure a majority of oral and written statements in support of park establishment. The NCCC also submitted a comprehensive 120-page plan for the park, entitled Prospectus for a North Cascades National Park. The Prospectus confirmed the NCCC's leadership in the park campaign. Â¶ The study team's report, The North Cascades, was published in October 1965, recommending the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. The Sierra Club published the influential book, The Wild Cascades: Forgotten Parkland, in 1965 as well, to draw further attention to the area. Public hearings were held in 1966 to discuss the study team's findings. On March 20, 1967, Senators Jackson and Magnuson introduced Senate Bill 1321, which established the North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The bill was passed in November, and the following year, in October 1968, the North Cascades National Park Service Complex was created by an act of Congress. Â¶ Another long struggle to which the NCCC was committed was passing the Wilderness Act. The legislative effort began in 1956 as a wilderness bill drafted by Howard Zahniser, director of the Wilderness Society. The bill called for the conservation of the nation's remaining wilderness. Despite initial opposition and numerous revisions, the Wilderness Act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. The act created the National Wilderness Preservation System and put 9.1 million acres of national forest land into the new system. It was the first wilderness protection legislation passed in the world. Â¶ The first major crisis to occur under the Wilderness Act began in 1967 with Kennecott Copper Corporation's plan to create an open-pit mine in Miners Ridge, a location inside the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area and close to Image Lake. Since Kennecott owned the mineral rights to the land, the Wilderness Act's clause regarding private ownership seemed to protect the mine's development. Under pressure from tremendous publicity and opposition by the NCCC and Washington congressmen, Kennecott decided to postpone its plans, although talk of commencing mining operations resumed in 1969 when copper prices soared. The land was later bought from Kennecott and the area protected from commercial interests. Â¶ The NCCC also participated in the debate over roadways in national parks. The Park Service program launched Mission 66 in 1956 to improve deteriorating and dangerous conditions in the national parks that largely resulted from a massive boom in visitors after World War II. Mission 66 expanded visitor capacity in the national parks to accommodate an estimated eighty million automobile tourists within ten years. The program called for adding more overnight accommodations, building visitor centers, and constructing park roads. The roadway debate continued in 1957, when the Washington State legislature authorized a survey for a cross-Cascades highway. On September 2, 1972, the highway, known as the North Cascades Highway, officially opened, to the dismay of NCCC members. Another debate began in 1961 regarding the Outdoor Advertising Act, which established billboard control along scenic highways. The NCCC called for more aggressive controls and restrictions of outdoor advertising than the controversial act established in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the Northwest. Â¶ Over the past third of a century, the NCCC has accomplished much in conservation, including the creation of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Glacier Peak Wilderness, William O. Douglas Wilderness (Cougar Lakes Wilderness Area), Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Mt. Baker Wilderness, Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, and others. The NCCC has also collaborated with British Columbia allies to block the raising of Ross Dam and to encourage the establishment of a U.S.-Canadian international park. In addition, the NCCC newsletter, The Wild Cascades, has kept its members and other conservationists informed of and dedicated to the various issues affecting the North Cascades. The North Cascades Conservation Council has been a leader in the protection and preservation of the North Cascades mountain range from the Columbia River to the U.S.-Canadian border. Â¶ "

1738-001,"Gandy, Joseph E.",Joseph E. Gandy papers,"Joseph Edward Gandy was born in Spokane, Washington October 9, 1904. His father was Spokane pioneer, Lloyd Edward Gandy. Joseph Gandy was raised in Spokane, received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1926 and graduated from the University of Washington Law School in 1929. In 1937 he married Laurene Tatlow. Â¶ Following law school, Gandy settled in Seattle and practiced law. During World War II he served as chief deputy regional director of the War Production Board for the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. In 1946 he founded the partnership of Smith Gandy Inc., a Ford automobile dealership. In addtion, Gandy maintained a law practice throughout his career. Â¶ In 1959 Joseph Gandy took a leave of absence from Smith Gandy to serve as President of Century 21 Exposition Inc., the non-profit corporation that was formed in 1957 to run the 1962 Seattle World's Fair. Planning for the Fair had been underway since 1955, when the Washington World's Fair Commission, chaired by Edward Carlson, began to meet. Gandy, who had been a member of the corporation from the start, took over from Carlson the job of chief statesman for the Fair. The first task he undertook was to win recognition for the Fair from the Bureau of International Expositions. Others before Gandy had attempted but failed. Gandy, recognizing that the Fair needed sanctioning in order to be a World's Fair and get foreign participation, made an all-out effort to persuade the Bureau. He visited Paris twice in 1960 to meet the representatives of the Bureau and did everything possible to satisfy their requirements, including shortening the duration of the Fair to six months. When he learned of the Bureau's concerns about potential labor problems, Gandy went to Paris with letters of support and no-strike assurances from the King County Labor Council and the Seattle Construction and Trades Council. On May 5, 1960 the Bureau granted tentative approval to the Seattle World's Fair. Â¶ Having achieved world recognition, Gandy returned to Europe again with William W. Phillips, the Fair's European representative, to sign up exhibitors. He also visited Latin America and Africa. Gandy signed up many nations, but some exhibitors backed out after signing. The Common Market nations, together with the members of Euratom and the Coal and Steel Community, had agreed to mount an exhibit, but a few weeks before opening the Fair rumors reached Gandy that they were going to pull out. He immediately flew to Europe, met with EEC leaders in Brussels and convinced them to reinstate their exhibit. Gandy was also personally responsible for persuading Ford Motor Company to build a pavilion at the Fair. Ford had repeatedly declined offers to exhibit, but Gandy, refusing to take no for an answer, drew upon his standing as a Ford dealer to persuade them. Among Gandy's other duties as President was hosting the succession of celebrities who visited the Fair throughout its run. Â¶ Joseph Gandy helped pilot the first American world's fair since World War II to its successful conclusion. Though Century 21 was not on a scale with the world's largest expositions, it was impressive and was often described as a \""jewel box\"" of a fair. When the Fair opened on April 21, 1962 its exhibits were complete. No previous world's fair had come so close to being ready on time. Century 21 exceeded expectations for attendance and when it closed, it was the first to finish with a profit. After the Fair, in 1963, Gandy and his family went on a world tour of 30 countries to personally thank them for their participation. Â¶ The other civic project for which Joseph Gandy was best known is the King County Stadium. The idea of a municipal domed stadium had been discussed as early as 1957, but the first stadium bond proposal was rejected by voters in a 1962 election. In 1966 Gandy led the second campaign for a stadium bond issue as chairman of King County Citizens for All-Purpose Stadium Now. Gandy argued that \""The value of a domed all-purpose stadium to Seattle and King County will far exceed that of the World's Fair.\"" On January 20, 1966 Gandy was also designated by the governor, the mayor of Seattle, the chairman of the King County Commission and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce to represent the state, county and city in discussions with the National Football League to obtain a football franchise. With assurances of an NFL franchise and hopes for a major league baseball team contingent on a stadium, the second bond issue narrowly failed passage on September 21, 1966. Â¶ Stadium proponents were not discouraged by the narrow defeat. In 1967 the Legislature passed enabling legislation authorizing King County to defer 2% of its hotel sales tax for the purpose of retiring stadium bonds and created a Stadium Commission to select a location for the stadium. Also in 1967, The American League voted to grant Seattle an expansion franchise contingent on the city being able to provide suitable stadium facilities. The stadium bond issue became part of the monumental Forward Thrust proposal which, on February 13, 1968, received approval from the required majority of voters. Â¶ In 1968 Joseph Gandy was appointed to head the Washington Stadium Commission and entered what was to be a controversial and prolonged site selection process. The selection of the stadium site seemed to be settled in 1968 when a research team, followed by the Stadium Commission, chose the Seattle Center site. After Gandy and the other Stadium Commissioners resigned in 1969, Frank Ruano launched a drive to submit the Seattle Center site to a vote. It was rejected by voters on May 17, 1970. Subsequently, a new Commission chose the King Street site and work on the Kingdome began near the end of 1971. Â¶ Gandy was President of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce from 1956-57. From 1957-59 he represented the Chamber of Commerce in its negotiation with the Jackson Hole Preserve in an effort to secure support for hotel accommodations at a high level in Mt. Rainier National Park. This effort was prompted by Mission 66, a National Park Service Plan for Mt. Rainier National Park introduced in 1956. The Jackson Hole Preserve Inc., an organization created by Laurence S. Rockefeller, conducted a study in 1959 of the need for a hotel in the park. Â¶ In 1960 Gandy served on the executive committee of the U.S.-Japan Centennial Royal Visit Committee. The Committee made preparations for the visit to Seattle by Japanese Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko. Â¶ In 1964 Joseph Gandy entered the race for the Republican nomination for governor. He campaigned actively for a few months, then dropped out of the race in July. Â¶ Joseph Gandy served in numerous civic organizations and headed many of them. He died of a heart attack in June 13, 1971. Â¶ "

1940-002,AFL-CIO. King County Labor Council of Washington,King County Labor Council records,"The King County Labor Council has long been the communal decision-making body of the various union locals in King County. From the mid-1920s until the reunification of the AFL and CIO in 1955, only AFL-affiliated unions were represented on the Council. At other times, however, the vast majority of King County's locals had a voice on the Council.

The Council has passed through at least four distinct periods in its history. The Council originally began in 1888 as the Western Central Labor Union. This body changed its name to the Central Labor Council of Seattle and Vicinity in 1905. These groups occasionally joined coalitions with Populists and other reform groups in local and state politics. Nonetheless, much of the early Council's energy was spent simply trying to survive. The second phase of the Council's history began roughly in 1914 with the labor shortage that allowed unions to organize much of Seattle. The Council grew increasingly radical in this period and became the dominant force in Seattle's powerful progressive coalition. The loss of the Council's power began with the mass layoffs of shipyard workers after World War I. These layoffs led the Council to call the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the only truly city-wide general strike in American history. Employers responded to the failed strike with an open shop drive that de-unionized most of King County. A series of internal power struggles plagued the Council after the strike. The Council voted to expel members of the Industrial Workers of the World in late 1919 and Communist Party members in 1925.

The growing conservative influence in the Council was solidified when Dave Beck and his Teamsters came to dominate the group in the late 1920s. The third phase of the Council's history was thus business unionism, Beck-style. Dave Beck began his career as a driver for the Council's cooperative laundry but rapidly rose to become the chief Teamster organizer west of the Rockies. Beck used the strategic position of truck drivers in the economy to start rebuilding the strength of organized labor in Seattle. If the Council declared a firm to be \""unfair to labor,\"" he could often prevent the firm from trucking its goods to market. Despite Beck's occasionally ruthless tactics, he believed that businesses had a right to make a profit. When the Great Depression spurred widespread organizing drives, many firms concluded that they would much rather deal with the avowedly anti-radical Beck than with a CIO union. The Council routinely backed Beck in his jurisdictional disputes with CIO and independent unions. Thus, by the end of World War II, Seattle was largely a closed-shop AFL town. Under Beck's reign, the Council stayed fairly aloof from politics, endorsing moderate pro-labor Democrats and spurning the leftist coalitions that fought for local and state offices.

The fourth stage of the Council's history, its reentry into local politics, began with the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955. The expanded Council was quickly put on the defensive by statewide right-to-work proposals in Initiative 198 in 1956 and Initiative 202 in 1958. The Council played a leading role in the campaigns that defeated these measures. After these victories, the Council went on the offensive. It started a pro-labor public relations campaign in 1959 that included donating money to charities and promoting radio and television appearances by labor leaders. Beginning in 1964, the Council's Committee on Political Education launched major voter registration drives before elections. The growth of public sector unions in the 1950s and 1960s, coupled with the addition of progressive CIO unions, led the Council to endorse expanded social services and public housing in this period. The Council also supported the efforts of Seattle civil rights groups during the 1960s. Nonetheless, the Council retained some traces of business unionism. It gave a no-strike pledge during the 1962 World's Fair and often helped the Chamber of Commerce lobby for subsidies for local businesses.

During the latter years of the 20th century, the period documented in Accession 1940-2, the council's executive secretaries were, in succession: James K. Bender, Dan Bickford, Ron Judd, and Steve Williamson.

In 2005, the name changed to Martin Luther King County Labor Council, commonly referred to as MLK Labor.

0001-009,Port Blakely Mill Company,Port Blakely Mill Company records,"Lumber mill.Â¶ At its height, the Port Blakely Mill Company was the largest on the Pacific Coast, and possibly in the entire world. Captain William Renton founded it in 1863 on Bainbridge Island, directly across from Seattle in the Puget Sound. Within a year the mill was turning out 50,000 board feet a day. The PBMCo expanded rapidly, as did the timber industry in Washington territory generally. (In the 1880s, the territory's annual timber production soared from 160 million board feet to over a billion). Although the California market was the most crucial, the PBMCo shipped its lumber throughout the Pacific Rim. The PBMCo briefly tried to enter the European market, but the long voyage around South America posed too great of a logistical challenge for consistent shipments to Europe. Â¶ In 1876, Renton incorporated the company in San Francisco with new partner Charles S. Holmes. Prior to 1885, the PBMCo obtained all its logs by contract with independent operators, since Renton did not want to take on either the additional risk or capital investment of logging camps. The decreasing supply of accessible high-quality lumber and the steady inflation in log prices led him to change his policy. He noted in 1864 that timber \""contiguous to the Sound is nearly exhausted.\"" The company purchased land north of Olympia, and constructed the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor Railroad to transport the logs. By 1891, the company held 80,000 acres of timber land. A fire destroyed the mill in 1888, but a new one, larger and more efficient, was in operation within the year. Â¶ The PBMCo would face other stiff challenges in the 1890s, and would do so without the guidance of Renton, who died in 1891. A devastating depression swept the United States in 1893, forcing the company to operate in a hostile economic climate. It also faced increased competition from eastern mills moving into the Pacific Northwest. The St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company managed to rival PBMCo's position as the largest mill in the region during the 1890s. Weyerhaeuser entered the region in 1900, purchasing 900,000 acres of timberland. The PBMCo became increasingly ill-suited for competition with firms better located for participation in the rail and cargo trades. Â¶ In February 1903 Renton's heirs sold the company to two men from Michigan, David E. Skinner and John W. Eddy. The mill burned again in 1907, and the one built to replace it was much smaller. By 1912, the new mill operated only sporadically. Demands generated by the First World War temporarily returned the mill's economic viability; after the war, the demand crashed, and so did the mill's brief economic resurgence. Eddy and Skinner closed it in 1922 and divided the PBMCo's assets. The defunct mill was dismantled in 1924. Eddy bought out Skinner in that same year, and from that point forward the PBMCo relied upon its timber holdings and was exclusively an Eddy family concern. Â¶ "

The museum also hosts nationally and internationally touring exhibitions such as Deep Storage, The Arsenal of Memory (1998), Thinking Print (1998), Inside Out: New Chinese Art (1999-2000) and Andy Warhol: Drawings, 1942-1987 (July 20 - October 8, 2000). Â¶ The museum's major renovation and expansion, completed in April 1997, quadrupled the museum's size - from 10,000 square feet to over 40,000 square feet. Increased size allowed for the addition of a 154-seat auditorium, a multi-media gallery, cafÃ©, bookstore and sculpture court along with improved facilities for art handling and storage and collections research.

Through its mission \""to protect, restore, and sustain Washington's environment for all,\"" the organization has served as a coordinating body on issues of statewide significance. Among other achievements, the WEC has worked to enforce and pass the State Environmental Policy Act, the State Superfund Law, the Growth Management Act, and the Shoreline Management Act. It also operates the Environmental Priorities Coalition and the Voter Education Program. Throughout its history, the organization has also focused on other issues related to carbon pollution, clean energy, water pollution, forests, and public lands.Â¶ In 1986 and 1987, the WEC was heavily involved with the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Implementation Project, which was the result of negotiations between the timber industry, the four natural resource agencies in Washington State, Indian tribes, and environmentalists. The Project is a cooperative plan for managing forest harvest practices on both state and private timberlands. Marcy Golde was involved with the negotiations, while Lisa Lombardy served as the WEC's statewide coordinator. Other WEC staff, through private funding, monitored timber harvest applications.Â¶ Another major legal case in which the WEC was involved concerned Washington State rules that imposed requirements on the design, equipment, reporting, and operations of oil tankers. Washington State, with the help of the WEC, defeated the trade association Intertanko, which represented operators of oil tanker ships. In 2000, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision on the basis that federal law pre-empts state rules. Â¶ "

1732-014,North Cascades Conservation Council,North Cascades Conservation Council records,"The North Cascades Conservation Council (NCCC) was organized in 1957 with the mission \""to protect and preserve the North Cascades' scenic, scientific, recreational, educational, and wilderness values.\"" For the next ten years, NCCC was dedicated to its main goal, the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. It was aided by other organizations dedicated to conservation, such as the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. Â¶ Conservation efforts targeting the North Cascades did not begin with NCCC. Concerns about the area were voiced as early as 1892, when a park proposal for Lake Chelan was presented but denounced as being against public interests. In 1937, the first formal proposal for a North Cascades National Park was submitted by the U.S. National Park Service and Owen A. Tomlinson. The proposal was impeded by opposition from the U.S. Forest Service, which had recently lost the battle over the formation of Olympic National Park. Â¶ In the mid-1950s, Grant McConnell, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focused on public land policy, raised the call for an organization to protect the North Cascades. Disturbed by the U.S. Forest Service's plans for timber sales, mining, and construction of a cross-mountain highway over Cascade Pass, McConnell convinced Polly Dyer to call a meeting at her home to discuss the threats to the North Cascades wilderness. McConnell's main objective was the formation of a single-issue conservation group dedicated to the North Cascades. Meeting attendees resisted McConnell's plan, citing the work being done on the issue by the Mountaineers Conservation Division, to which many attendees belonged. The Mountaineers Glacier Peak Subcommitee, chaired by Philip Zalesky, was also praised for its concentration on an important geographic area of the North Cascades. After the meeting, McConnell and other Sierra Club members worked to persuade North Cascades conservation leaders to form an organization. Patrick Goldsworthy was one of those leaders, and he later became the long-time president of NCCC. Â¶ Goldsworthy had proven himself to be a committed Northwest conservationist in the early 1950s. After moving to Seattle in 1952 to accept a research appointment in the University of Washington School of Medicine, he joined the Mountaineers Conservation Division and met John and Polly Dyer. Goldsworthy, together with his wife, Jane, and the Dyers, established the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club in 1954. Â¶ On March 23, 1957, during a Glacier Peak conference in Portland, Oregon, Goldsworthy and others took up the call to protect the North Cascades. Twenty-six people from Washington, Oregon, and California were present for the formation of the North Cascades Conservation Council. NCCC designated its immediate goal as the formation of the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area. Bylaws were written and officers were elected. Philip Zalesky served as president, Pat Goldsworthy as first vice-president, Una Davies as second vice-president, Polly Dyer as secretary, and Yvonne Prater as treasurer. Harvey Manning later joined the group as editor of the NCCC's newsletter. Â¶ With Patrick Goldsworthy serving as leader of both NCCC and the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club, assistance from the national Sierra Club and its executive director, David Brower, was quickly forthcoming. The Sierra Club had begun leading its first outing trips into the North Cascades a year earlier. In 1957, the Sierra Club produced the film, The Wilderness Alps of Stehekin. Publicizing the cause of the North Cascades, the film was shown extensively by the NCCC and other conservation groups. It was also circulated to public officials and members of Congress. Â¶ The Sierra Club furthered its commitment to the Pacific Northwest in 1961 by hiring Michael McCloskey, the first Northwest Conservation representative. The representative was funded by the Federation of the Western Outdoor Clubs and served as a valuable lobbyist and advocate for the formation of national parks and wilderness areas in the Northwest. Â¶ By 1959, support for a North Cascades National Park was strong among conservation organizations, including the NCCC, the National Parks Association, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Cascadians. Conservationists called for the U.S. Forest Service to suspend its plans for timber sales and road construction, and to allow the U.S. National Park Service to conduct a study of the possible park area. Washington Congressman Thomas Pelly, a vocal advocate of conservation, asked the U.S. National Park Service to conduct the study, only to be reprimanded by the director of the U.S. Forest Service for neglecting to ask for permission. Congressman Pelly, with the assistance of the Interior Department and groups such as the NCCC, then attempted to introduce legislation to order the study, but was unsuccessful. Â¶ In 1961, Pelly was presented with a petition bearing 22,000 signatures in favor of a park study. That same year, Washington Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson also joined the debate when they encouraged Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman to develop a forest management plan for the contested areas. Freeman imposed a temporary moratorium on logging, which ended the following year, only to be asked by Pelly to impose a stricter moratorium on logging until a national park study was held. Freeman denied the request, since the U.S. Forest Service had completed a high mountain management policy for the North Cascades. Â¶ In 1963, after disputes between the U.S. Park and Forest Services were settled, a joint study of the North Cascades was announced. The study was recommended by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, and the study team was chaired by the director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Edward C. Crafts. Public hearings to introduce the study were held in Seattle, Wenatchee, and Mount Vernon. The NCCC worked diligently to ensure a majority of oral and written statements in support of park establishment. The NCCC also submitted a comprehensive 120-page plan for the park, entitled Prospectus for a North Cascades National Park. The Prospectus confirmed the NCCC's leadership in the park campaign. Â¶ The study team's report, The North Cascades, was published in October 1965, recommending the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. The Sierra Club published the influential book, The Wild Cascades: Forgotten Parkland, in 1965 as well, to draw further attention to the area. Public hearings were held in 1966 to discuss the study team's findings. On March 20, 1967, Senators Jackson and Magnuson introduced Senate Bill 1321, which established the North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The bill was passed in November, and the following year, in October 1968, the North Cascades National Park Service Complex was created by an act of Congress. Â¶ Another long struggle to which the NCCC was committed was passing the Wilderness Act. The legislative effort began in 1956 as a wilderness bill drafted by Howard Zahniser, director of the Wilderness Society. The bill called for the conservation of the nation's remaining wilderness. Despite initial opposition and numerous revisions, the Wilderness Act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. The act created the National Wilderness Preservation System and put 9.1 million acres of national forest land into the new system. It was the first wilderness protection legislation passed in the world. Â¶ The first major crisis to occur under the Wilderness Act began in 1967 with Kennecott Copper Corporation's plan to create an open-pit mine in Miners Ridge, a location inside the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area and close to Image Lake. Since Kennecott owned the mineral rights to the land, the Wilderness Act's clause regarding private ownership seemed to protect the mine's development. Under pressure from tremendous publicity and opposition by the NCCC and Washington congressmen, Kennecott decided to postpone its plans, although talk of commencing mining operations resumed in 1969 when copper prices soared. The land was later bought from Kennecott and the area protected from commercial interests. Â¶ The NCCC also participated in the debate over roadways in national parks. The Park Service program launched Mission 66 in 1956 to improve deteriorating and dangerous conditions in the national parks that largely resulted from a massive boom in visitors after World War II. Mission 66 expanded visitor capacity in the national parks to accommodate an estimated eighty million automobile tourists within ten years. The program called for adding more overnight accommodations, building visitor centers, and constructing park roads. The roadway debate continued in 1957, when the Washington State legislature authorized a survey for a cross-Cascades highway. On September 2, 1972, the highway, known as the North Cascades Highway, officially opened, to the dismay of NCCC members. Another debate began in 1961 regarding the Outdoor Advertising Act, which established billboard control along scenic highways. The NCCC called for more aggressive controls and restrictions of outdoor advertising than the controversial act established in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the Northwest. Â¶ Over the past third of a century, the NCCC has accomplished much in conservation, including the creation of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Glacier Peak Wilderness, William O. Douglas Wilderness (Cougar Lakes Wilderness Area), Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Mt. Baker Wilderness, Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, and others. The NCCC has also collaborated with British Columbia allies to block the raising of Ross Dam and to encourage the establishment of a U.S.-Canadian international park. In addition, the NCCC newsletter, The Wild Cascades, has kept its members and other conservationists informed of and dedicated to the various issues affecting the North Cascades. The North Cascades Conservation Council has been a leader in the protection and preservation of the North Cascades mountain range from the Columbia River to the U.S.-Canadian border. Â¶ "

During that time he had a significant role in Seattle's history. Â¶ Matthews's life reflects many of the currents and tensions that prevailed in America from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of the Second World War. He was deeply aware of the change in America from a rural orientation to an urban and industrialized one. Involved with the progressive movement, he found the implications of the First World War and the radical labor movement in Seattle threatening. In this context Matthews fought to make the Church a moving force within society and preserve his concept of religious orthodoxy. This led him to become a proponent of fundamentalism and an opponent of modernism within the Presbyterian church. Â¶ Born in Calhoun, Georgia, on September 24, 1867, Matthews received his formal education at the town's local academy. He was ordained there in 1887, and after brief ministries in Calhoun and Dalton, Georgia, he accepted a ministry in Jackson, Tennessee. Clearly part of the social gospel movement, Matthews attempted to adapt the church to urban conditions. During his years in Jackson, 1896-1901, he was instrumental in building a hospital, organizing a night school, and founding a local humane society. His work as an organizer and preacher earned him an honorary doctorate from Tennessee Normal University and soon after, a call to become minister to Seattle's First Presbyterian Church. Â¶ Matthews viewed himself as a progressive with the dual mission of expanding his church and rooting out the corruption prevalent in Seattle at that time. Membership in his congregation grew to ten thousand, the largest Presbyterian church in the world. At the same time, he waged active campaigns against Seattle mayors, police chiefs, business leaders, saloon keepers, and others whom he perceived as evil. Â¶ By 1912 Matthews had been elected moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. This led to a close association with Woodrow Wilson, and Matthews became a frequent guest at the White House. As Wilson's devoted follower, Matthews began to consider opponents of Wilson as well as Seattle's radical labor leaders in the International Woodworkers of the World grave threats to the security of the nation. Consequently he became increasingly conservative, calling for restriction of immigration and repressive measures in the context of the red scare of the 1920s, and increasingly strident in his support for such issues as Prohibition, fundamentalism, and William Jennings Bryan's crusade against the teaching of evolution. Strongly opinionated, Matthews made many enemies, but he also had thousands of devoted followers. While his theology was relatively simple, his life reveals the complexity of forces working in America as this Southerner in the Pacific Northwest attempted to lead Seattle to his own particular vision of righteousness.Â¶ "

0001-004,Port Blakely Mill Company,Port Blakely Mill Company records,"Lumber mill.Â¶ At its height, the Port Blakely Mill Company was the largest on the Pacific Coast, and possibly in the entire world. Captain William Renton founded it in 1863 on Bainbridge Island, directly across from Seattle in the Puget Sound. Within a year the mill was turning out 50,000 board feet a day. The PBMCo expanded rapidly, as did the timber industry in Washington territory generally. (In the 1880s, the territory's annual timber production soared from 160 million board feet to over a billion). Although the California market was the most crucial, the PBMCo shipped its lumber throughout the Pacific Rim. The PBMCo briefly tried to enter the European market, but the long voyage around South America posed too great of a logistical challenge for consistent shipments to Europe. Â¶ In 1876, Renton incorporated the company in San Francisco with new partner Charles S. Holmes. Prior to 1885, the PBMCo obtained all its logs by contract with independent operators, since Renton did not want to take on either the additional risk or capital investment of logging camps. The decreasing supply of accessible high-quality lumber and the steady inflation in log prices led him to change his policy. He noted in 1864 that timber \""contiguous to the Sound is nearly exhausted.\"" The company purchased land north of Olympia, and constructed the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor Railroad to transport the logs. By 1891, the company held 80,000 acres of timber land. A fire destroyed the mill in 1888, but a new one, larger and more efficient, was in operation within the year. Â¶ The PBMCo would face other stiff challenges in the 1890s, and would do so without the guidance of Renton, who died in 1891. A devastating depression swept the United States in 1893, forcing the company to operate in a hostile economic climate. It also faced increased competition from eastern mills moving into the Pacific Northwest. The St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company managed to rival PBMCo's position as the largest mill in the region during the 1890s. Weyerhaeuser entered the region in 1900, purchasing 900,000 acres of timberland. The PBMCo became increasingly ill-suited for competition with firms better located for participation in the rail and cargo trades. Â¶ In February 1903 Renton's heirs sold the company to two men from Michigan, David E. Skinner and John W. Eddy. The mill burned again in 1907, and the one built to replace it was much smaller. By 1912, the new mill operated only sporadically. Demands generated by the First World War temporarily returned the mill's economic viability; after the war, the demand crashed, and so did the mill's brief economic resurgence. Eddy and Skinner closed it in 1922 and divided the PBMCo's assets. The defunct mill was dismantled in 1924. Eddy bought out Skinner in that same year, and from that point forward the PBMCo relied upon its timber holdings and was exclusively an Eddy family concern. Â¶ "

The first president was Edmund S. Meany. Standing committees were appointed at that first meeting of the club to take over the work and organization of the two main activities, the local and annual outings. The number of standing committees grew with the increasing membership and interests of the club. Mountain climbing has been one of the major interests. In 1935 climbing classes were organized to teach the fundamentals of Mountaineering. The Mountaineers were the first organized group to develop skiing in the Northwest. There are branches in Tacoma, Everett, and Olympia. The Climbing Committee was one of the early standing committees."
1988-005,"Haley, Frederick",Frederick Haley papers,"Frederick T. Haley was a Tacoma businessman and civic leader. His chief interests in civic life were education, civil rights, and civil liberties. Â¶ Frederick T. Haley was born in Tacoma, Washington, on June 29, 1912. He grew up in Tacoma and attended Stadium High School. His father, J. Clifford Haley, co-founded Brown & Haley, a candy manufacturing company known for its signature product, Almond Roca, in 1912. Fred Haley earned a B.A. from Dartmouth in 1935 and returned to Tacoma to work as a salesman for Brown & Haley. He also studied business at the University of Washington. During WWII Haley served in the Pacific as a Navy harbor pilot. There he developed both a lifelong love of the Pacific Islands and, in the face of the stark realities of war, a drive to dedicate himself to meaningful and difficult civic causes. After the war, Haley married Dorothy Geyer and had four children. He became chairman and chief executive officer of Brown & Haley after his father's death in 1954. Â¶ In the succeeding years, Haley involved himself in a myriad of civic causes. In the 1950s and 1960s his efforts were focused mainly on education and civil rights and liberties. During his tenure on the Tacoma School Board, on which he served two terms as chair, Haley was an outspoken critic of de-facto school segregation and advocated bussing programs as a remedy. He charged that segregated schools hindered the development of all children in a racially diverse society. As a school board member, Haley took another stand on a controversial issue when he spoke out in defense of Jean Schuddakopf, an elementary school counselor who refused to submit to questioning by the House Un-American Activities Committee. He served as president of the Pierce County School Directors' Association in 1957. Haley continued his work for civil rights as a founding member of the Washington Citizens' Committee for Civil Rights Legislation. During this time he also served on the Washington State Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and on the boards of the Washington State Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Washington State Board Against Discrimination. Â¶ Under Haley's leadership, Brown & Haley competed successfully on the world market and earned a Presidential E for Export award in the 1960s. Haley believed strongly in the value of American awareness of international issues; he took his family on extended trips to Europe and encouraged his children to study multiple foreign languages. These experiences were useful to Haley in the arena of international trade. He served on the Washington State International Trade Fair's (WSITF) board of trustees, planning committee, and executive committee during the 1970s. He was president of WSITF in 1974 and attended several trips to Asia and the USSR with WSITF delegations. Haley was also a member of the Pacific Northwest International Trade Council. He served on the steering committee of the Regional Export Expansion Council in 1968. Haley also supported several organizations that promoted international peace and friendship. These included Turn Toward Peace and its successor, the World Without War Council; Platform for Peace; Focus International; Friendship Force; and the United Nations Association Advisory Council on Nuclear Proliferation. He was state chairman of Washington United Nations Day in 1979. Â¶ Education remained an interest throughout Haley's civic career. He was active in the National Committee for Support of the Public Schools throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. He served on the board of advisors of the U.S. Department of Education Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education in 1980 and 1981. Governor Spellman appointed Haley as chair of the Washington State Temporary Committee on Educational Policies Structure and Management in 1983. Â¶ Often described as an educational visionary, Haley favored progressive and experimental approaches to the improvement of public education. In the mid-1970s he chaired the board of trustees of Tacoma's Prometheus College. The college, which closed due to financial difficulties around 1979, allowed students to design their own courses and offered a number of correspondence and evening courses designed to make post-secondary education more accessible for non-traditional students. Haley went on to serve on the board of governors of the The Evergreen State College (TESC) from 1978 to the mid-1980s. A public college formed in 1971, TESC matched Haley's progressive approach to education. Evergreen encourages self-directed learning, maintains small classes with high levels of student participation, and issues written student evaluations instead of grades. Â¶ Even as Haley scaled back his civic activities in the mid-1980s, he took on a new position on the University of Washington Tacoma (UWT) Siting Advisory Board. Haley advocated the idea that a branch campus of Washington's largest public university would be a valuable asset to the citizens of Tacoma and its vicinity. (Tacoma was already home to two private universities, Pacific Lutheran University and the University of Puget Sound.) In 1991, after several years of planning, the University of Washington opened its second branch campus. A driving force behind the successful birth of the UWT, Haley gave the featured speech at the university's first full-fledged commencement ceremony in 1992. Â¶ After a lifetime of civil service, Haley's most prestigious awards and honors included a 1963 John Hay Fellowship for study at the Williams College Summer Institute in the Humanities, an honorary doctorate from the University of Puget Sound in 1970, and the William O. Douglas Award from the Washington Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1985. Frederick T. Haley died in 2005. Â¶ "

Among other achievements, the WEC has worked to enforce and pass the State Environmental Policy Act, the State Superfund Law, the Growth Management Act, and the Shoreline Management Act. It also operates the Environmental Priorities Coalition and the Voter Education Program. Throughout its history, the organization has also focused on other issues related to carbon pollution, clean energy, water pollution, forests, and public lands.Â¶ In 1986 and 1987, the WEC was heavily involved with the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Implementation Project, which was the result of negotiations between the timber industry, the four natural resource agencies in Washington State, Indian tribes, and environmentalists. The Project is a cooperative plan for managing forest harvest practices on both state and private timberlands. Marcy Golde was involved with the negotiations, while Lisa Lombardy served as the WEC's statewide coordinator. Other WEC staff, through private funding, monitored timber harvest applications.Â¶ Another major legal case in which the WEC was involved concerned Washington State rules that imposed requirements on the design, equipment, reporting, and operations of oil tankers. Washington State, with the help of the WEC, defeated the trade association Intertanko, which represented operators of oil tanker ships.

0038-002,"Cotterill, George F. (George Fletcher), 1865-1958",George F. Cotterill papers,"Civil servant, elected official, moral reformer, surveyor, and engineer, George Fletcher Cotterill helped shape the city of Seattle in the literal as well as the figurative sense. Â¶ Cotterill was born in England to Alice and Robert Cotterill on Nov. 18, 1865. In 1872, the Cotterill family immigrated to the United States and settled in Montclair, New Jersey. Cotterill graduated from high school as class valedictorian in 1881, and studied surveying and engineering under the tutelage of a New Jersey county engineer for the next three years. During this time he participated in the platting and construction of Arlington cemetery. Â¶ Cotterill migrated to the Pacific Northwest in 1884. For several years he worked as a surveyor on various land, mining, and railroad projects before being hired by surveyor R.H. Thomson. With Thomson, Cotterill surveyed for the city's first sewer system and platted additions to rapidly expanding Seattle. When Thomson was appointed city engineer in 1882, Cotterill became his assistant. Among his responsibilities as assistant city engineer, Cotterill was assigned to the city water department and became instrumental in the development of the Cedar River water supply. The city, needing a fresher and less expensive source of water than the Lake Washington pumping system, approved the Cedar River gravity system in the mid 1890s. At the time, the city was out of funds to pay for the new water system, and Cotterill, a member of the task force responsible for improving Seattle's water supply, proposed the novel revenue bond system for municipal ownership of public utilities. The first of its kind in the United States, this public utilities plan was approved by citizen vote in 1896. Cotterill was also involved in the project to convert the tide flats south of the city into property capable of development. Â¶ Cotterill's advocacy of public utilities drew him into the political arena. In 1900 the nonpartisan party, through which he was promoting public utilities, nominated him for mayor. Cotterill accepted the nomination contingent on backing from the Democratic Party, which he received, and he ran as a Democratic candidate. Though Cotterill had grown up a Republican, the recent campaign of William Jennings Bryan had made him a Democrat. Cotterill did not win this election or the next, but in 1906 he ran for the state senate and won. One of his principal accomplishments while in office was the framing of the successful amendment to the Washington State constitution recognizing female suffrage. Because of this amendment, he recalled later with pride, his mother had been able to cast a ballot for the first time at the age of 75. Cotterill received the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 1908 and again in 1910, but lost both times. Â¶ In 1912 Cotterill again ran for mayor, this time on a platform demanding moral reform. In an \""open\"" city where vice had flourished since the Klondike gold rush, his campaign targeted Hiram Gill's legacy of graft in city government as well as rampant prostitution and gambling houses. Cotterill won this election, helped in part by the new ability of women to vote. Cotterill's term was punctuated by conflict and controversy, due to corruption in municipal government and the police department, labor unrest, an unsympathetic Seattle Times, and other causes. He regularly confronted opposition to his moral reform agenda, which was for the most part driven by strong temperance beliefs. Â¶ At the center of Cotterill's commitment to moral reform was his life-long crusade on behalf of temperance. His parents had joined the United Kingdom Temperance Alliance in 1865, consequently indoctrinating Cotterill from birth. As a child in England, Cotterill attended the local chapter his mother had formed of the Band of Hope, an organization for children's temperance education. Cotterill attended his first convention of the International Order of Good Templars in 1897 and remained involved in this organization for the rest of his life. He served for a time as Grand Secretary of the Washington State division and later as Chief Templar of the national division. In addition to his work with the Templars, he was a member of the Anti-Saloon League. In 1909, Cotterill was appointed by President Taft as U.S. representative to the International Congress against Alcoholism; in 1913 President Wilson reappointed him. Â¶ Cotterill did not seek a second term as mayor; instead he worked as a surveyor and engineer in private practice. From 1916 to 1919 he served as chief engineer of the state Highway Department. He returned to Seattle politics in 1922, running for Seattle port commissioner. He won, and served four consecutive three-year terms, 1922 to 1934. Â¶ Following his port commissioner post, Cotterill ran unsuccessfully for at least five various city and state offices between 1932 and 1951. He also ran for governor in 1928. Besides these campaigns, Cotterill worked a variety of jobs. Many of these were temporary positions, such as his position as consultant to the State Planning Council, and Cotterill faced some financial difficulty during the depression. He met with marginal success in his endeavors to get work under the WPA, in large part due to his advanced age. But Cotterill kept working, retiring at 84 only because he was forced out of his job as draftsman in the King County Assessor's office by a new county regulation of compulsory retirement for all employees over 70. Â¶ Cotterill was also active civically. He was a founding member of the Queen City Good Roads Club, and served as chairman of the paths committee. He was responsible for designing, surveying, and laying out over 25 miles of bicycle paths throughout Seattle, which became the basis of the city's boulevard system. He also wrote on Seattle and Northwest history, and in 1928 he published The Climax of a World Quest, a history of Puget Sound. Â¶ Cotterill's entire immediate family eventually migrated to the Puget Sound area. Cotterill married Cora Gormley in 1890, and in 1892 daughter Ruth was born. Ruth died in 1900, and George and Cora had no more children of their own. They did, however, raise a niece, Marjorie Avery nee Smith, as a foster daughter. Cora died in 1936 and Cotterill later married Katherine Owens. He died in 1958, at 92Â¶ "

1885-007,"Paul, William Lewis, 1885-1977",William Lewis Paul papers,"William Lewis Paul (1885-1977) was a pioneering Indian rights attorney and a leading figure in the campaign for native Alaskan rights. Paul was born in 1885 to parents who both had Tlingit mothers and European fathers. His mother, Matilda Kinnan Paul (Tamaree), was a Presbyterian missionary who worked at the Sitka Industrial Training School. Paul was educated at this school and later at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. He adopted the Carlisle School's assimilationist ideals and its assertion that Indians should have the same rights and privileges as other American citizens. Paul later graduated from Whitworth College in Spokane and studied law through correspondence courses offered by LaSalle University. In 1920 he returned to Alaska. His brother Louis was Grand Secretary of the Alaska Native Brotherhood (ANB), and he convinced William to stay in Alaska and work for the ANB. Â¶ The Paul brothers dominated the ANB from 1920 to 1940. William was elected Grand Secretary in 1920, the same year he passed the bar, making him the first Alaska native attorney. The ANB re-elected him Grand Secretary in 1921, 1922, 1935, 1938, and 1951. He won the office of Grand President in 1928, 1929, and 1955. Louis served as Grand Secretary twice and as Grand President three times between 1919 and 1939. The ANB, founded in 1912 by Tlingit Presbyterians associated with the Sitka Industrial Training School, originally saw its mission as civilizing the Indians of Southeast Alaska. In 1915 the ANB successfully lobbied the territorial legislature to pass a law giving citizenship and voting rights to natives who learned English and held jobs in the cash economy. The Pauls retained the ANB's focus on assimilating and Christianizing Indians. They argued, however, that Alaska natives were already US citizens by birth, and were therefore entitled to the rights and privileges associated with citizenship. The district court finally adopted this position in 1922, when William Paul successfully defended the right of his brother's father-in-law to vote in US vs. Charlie Jones. Â¶ William Paul made the ANB a major force in Alaskan politics. He spent much of the early 1920s organizing new ANB chapters throughout southeast Alaska, boosting membership from 100 in 1920 to 2,200 by 1935. He also started and edited a newspaper, Alaska Fisherman, published in Ketchikan from 1923 to 1932. The paper devoted much of its space to denouncing white cannery owners who monopolized native fishing grounds. William Paul used his newspaper and his ANB connections to great advantage in his successful 1924 and 1926 campaigns for the Alaska legislature, becoming the first native Alaskan to serve in that body. He passed a bill that made Alaska natives eligible to receive assistance under the territory's widows, orphans, and old age pension laws. Paul also fended off a challenge to native voting rights in the form of a literacy test. The law passed, but Paul amended it to exclude from its provisions all those who had previously voted. Without this amendment, the literacy test would have disenfranchised most of the native population. Charges that Paul accepted campaign contributions from canneries cost him his bid for re-election in 1928. He also lost his campaigns for territorial attorney general in 1930 and 1932. Nonetheless, Paul continued his successful private law practice. He tried many Indian rights cases, including one that forced the Ketchikan public schools to accept Indian children in 1929. Â¶ In the mid 1930s, William Paul worked for the ANB in Washington, DC. He authored a bill that allowed the Tlingit and Haida Indians to sue the government in a test case to determine the validity of their land claims; Congress passed this law in 1935. Paul was also instrumental in extending the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) to Alaska in 1936. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) then hired Paul to help villages draft IRA constitutions. Paul, however, suffered several setbacks in the late 1930s. In 1937 the Alaska Bar Association prohibited Paul from practicing law on the grounds that he had defrauded a client. The BIA fired Paul shortly thereafter. Â¶ The ANB was divided sharply over whether to allow William Paul a major role in planning the Tlingit-Haida land claims suit. Paul would not be readmitted to the Bar until January 1959. His disbarment reduced his influence in the ANB, which turned to the rival Peratrovich family for leadership. Nonetheless, the BIA required the Haida and Tlingit to form a joint council to decide how to prosecute the suit and how to distribute the benefits, and Paul was elected head of this council in 1941. The Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska (CCTHITA), founded in 1935, became one of the leading organizations campaigning for native Alaskan rights from the 1940s onwards. Paul's two sons, William Lackey Paul (often referred to as William L. Paul, Jr.) and Louis Frederick Paul (known as Fred Paul), were designated attorneys for the case against the government. The BIA and the Peratroviches removed the Pauls from the case in 1944, hiring instead the nationally known attorney James Curry. Â¶ William Paul dissented from Curry's contention that the Tlingit and Haida were distinct tribal groups whose land holdings had been usurped by whites. Paul argued that the â€˜Tlingit' and â€˜Haida', as represented by the CCTHIA, reflected linguistic rather than tribal groupings. He believed that class action for Native lands claims must be brought by individual tribes rather than the CCTHIA. Paul helped BIA Commissioner Dillon Meyer remove Curry from the case in 1953, forcing the Tlingit and Haida to hire attorney Israel Weissbrodt. Meanwhile, Paul and his sons, despite great opposition from the ANB, brought a series of cases designed to force the courts to accept Paul's theories about the Haida and Tlingit claims. The cases culminated with Tee-Hit-Ton vs. US (1955). The Supreme Court stated that compensation could not be awarded for Native Land Claims unless recognized specifically by Congress, and rejected Paul's theory about the Tlingit and Haida. The CCTHIA was later re-organized, however, in order to reflect more accurately tribal structures in Southeast Alaska. Although considered a setback for Native rights, the Tee-Hit-Ton case did not end the Tlingit-Haida Land Claims action. The Court of Claims ruled in 1959 that the Tlingit and Haida had occupied and owned the entire area of southeast Alaska at the time the state was purchased by the US in 1867. Compensation of $7.5 million was awarded to the CCTHIA in 1968. Organizations including the ANB and the Alaska Federation of Natives International would continue meanwhile to campaign for Native land claim settlements across Alaska. Â¶ Paul moved to Seattle following the Tee-Hit-Ton case, and became gradually less active within the ANB. He adopted the role of an advisor rather than a leader within the organization. He frequently sent open letters to the ANB membership that set out his goals for the organization and his opinions of its leaders' policies. Although he was not active in the passage of the landmark 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, his sons were and corresponded with him on the matter. The settlement awarded both land and compensation to Alaskan Natives, to be administered by twelve regional corporations within the state and one outside. Paul would remain involved with Native rights issues and organizations through the final years of his life. He practiced law as late as 1972, and paid active dues to the Alaska Bar Association until 1974. William Lewis Paul died in 1977. Â¶ "

0048-002,"Suzzallo, Henry, 1875-1933",Henry Suzzallo papers,"Henry Suzzallo was president of the University of Washington from 1915 to 1926; president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching from 1913 to 1933; arbitrator of the National War Labor Policies Board; and chairman of the Washington State Council of Defence from 1917 to1918. He also worked toward the adoption of better living and working conditions for loggers in the lumber industry. He died in 1933. Â¶ Glenn Hughes, who founded the University of Washington (UW) Dramatic Art Department under Henry Suzzallo, described him as \""a brilliant man, small and dynamic--the Napoleon of higher education.\"" The characterization was apt; Suzzallo's career was marked by both tremendous achievement and bitter controversies. He was born in 1875 to Croatian immigrants. Following a sickly childhood, Suzzallo began college at the State Normal School in his home town of San Jose, California, lacking both the money and the grades to attend his first choice, Stanford. After two years he graduated, taking a teaching job in a two-room school in Alviso, California. His degree from the Normal School and money from teaching removed the academic and financial barriers, allowing him to attend Stanford. For the next eighteen years, Suzzallo would shuffle between Stanford and Columbia, first pursuing his education, and later as a faculty member at both institutions. During this time, he managed to win himself an increasingly prestigious reputation. When the UW began searching for a new president in 1914, Suzzallo's name was on the short list of candidates. Â¶ In 1914, the UW was a small frontier college undergoing the first growing pains of becoming a major university. It claimed an enrollment of more than 3,000 students, small by the standards of the major American universities of the time, but still a tremendous increase over previous years. It also suffered from a less-than-robust budget. James R. Angell, the Regents' first choice for president, declined the job, primarily because he considered the UW underfunded. Suzzallo was the Regents' second choice, and he accepted the challenge. Even though money never flowed freely, he did prove remarkably adept at squeezing funding from both private donors and the Legislature. Plans for a magnificent new library, patterned after a medieval cathedral, symbolized his success in expanding the size of the campus and the prestige of the university. (The library would eventually bear his name). During this time, enrollment had burgeoned to over 10,000. Suzzallo further augmented his stature in the state during World War I, when he was president of the Washington Council of Defense, which had primary responsibility for the state's war effort. The \""Napoleon of higher education\"" was not to be spared his Waterloo, however. Â¶ The 1924 election of governor Roland Hartley would shatter the relative calm of Suzzallo's presidency. Hartley won on a platform promising government retrenchment and lower taxes. He also had a record of long-standing antagonism towards the UW, which he saw as a hotbed of socialism. \""Education is a fine thing,\"" he acknowledged, \""but that is not all there is to the game of life.\"" The year of the election, Suzzallo had published his book Our Faith in Education, written primarily to present the case for higher education against those who wanted to limit it in favor of tax reduction. Not surprisingly, Hartley's parsimony quickly conflicted with Suzzallo's educational vision. Suzzallo's high salary--$18,000 a year, larger than any other state official--made him and the University especially vulnerable to attack. Not only did Hartley want to curtail university expenditures, he also proposed overhauling the funding and administration system for the state's colleges and universities. Suzzallo did nothing to hide his strong objections to the governor's agenda. The battle spread to the Legislature and the Board of Regents, both Suzzallo allies. Each camp insisted adamantly, if implausibly, that it represented a political virtue intent on rescuing higher education from the political machinations of its opponents. Â¶ Hartley overcame the obstacle of the recalcitrant Regents by removing members supportive of Suzzallo. The Board, now dominated by Hartley's new appointees, put Suzzallo on indefinite leave-of-absence when he refused to resign. Suzzallo's ouster created a political firestorm, although a petition drive for a gubernatorial recall election, despite early momentum, sputtered, and failed to collect the required number of signatures. Suzzallo was flooded immediately with job offers. He decided to accept election as chairman of the board of the Carnegie Foundation. He remained affiliated with the Carnegie Foundation until complications following a heart attack in Seattle claimed his life on September 25, 1933. Â¶ "

It was the first women's organization on campus and was organized before the incorporation of the national YWCA in 1906. In its early years, the UW YWCA was mostly a religious organization, offering Bible study groups, and devotional and missionary meetings. Throughout the 1910s, members volunteered to perform mission work and teach English to Japanese immigrants in local settlement houses. In 1916 the tenth anniversary of the national YWCA's founding was celebrated through the national jubilee. Â¶ In 1930 after the State Legislature prohibited religious organizations from being housed on the University campus, the UW YWCA moved off campus. In 1940 it merged with the UW YMCA and the two organizations operated jointly for the next thirty years . The UW YMCA-YWCA were housed in Eagleson Hall from 1940 to 1964. Eagleson Hall was sold to the University of Washington in 1964, and a new, spacious building was completed in 1965 at 4525 19th Ave. N.E. Â¶ In 1962 UW denied a campus group space for a talk by Gus Hall, general secretary of the American Communist Party. Students petitioned the UW YMCA-YWCA for rental use of Eagleson Hall, which was granted after much debate. The decision to allow a Communist speaker use YMCA-YWCA resources sparked immediate outrage and support. Members of the general public, students, faculty, and other YMCA-YWCA executives voiced their opinions through phone calls, letters, and newspaper articles. Some believed in the upholding of freedom of speech ; others were outraged by the \""unAmerican\"" and \""un-Christian\"" nature of the Communist Party. The topic of Hall's speech was the McCarran Internal Security Act (1950), which required registration of Communist party members and attempted to criminalize the party. Elizabeth Jackson and Frank Mark, respective executive directors for the UW YMCA-YWCA, made the difficult decision to allow Hall a speaking platform. (Elizabeth Jackson later went on to head the Western Region of the National Student YWCA.) After the controversial event, the organizations drafted an open platform policy, affirming their commitment to freedom of speech and intellectual pursuit. Throughout the 1960s, speakers and forums were sponsored by the UW YMCA-YWCA on diverse topics such as LSD use, the beatnik or \""fringie\"" problem on University Way, capital punishment, racism, and birth control. Â¶ 1970 was a pivotal year for the UW YWCA, marking its declaration of autonomy from the YMCA and subsequent move to 4224 University Way N.E. The effects of the second wave of the women's movement can be seen in its motivation for independent status, namely its commitment to \""the development of a separate, visible identity of self-determining women-not identical to, but equal to men.\"" Over the course of a decade, the UW YWCA pioneered feminist programming, providing an extensive range of services and activities not only for UW students but also for women throughout the Seattle area. Many of the UW YWCA's programs were considered radical or controversial , and pushed the understanding of what a YWCA meant for women and a community. Â¶ The Abortion Birth Control (ABC) Referral Service was formed after a UW student group, the Committee for Abortion Reform , was ordered off campus for advocating passage of a 1970 abortion reform bill (Referendum 20) in Washington State. ABC found a home at the UW YWCA, disbanding as a politically-focused group and reforming as a support service. The ABC Referral Service provided doctor referrals, counseling and advocacy to women considering abortion procedures, as well as birth control methods, and a range of other reproductive health topics. ABC staff regularly visited the offices of doctors providing abortions and gathered information from abortion patients about their experiences to ensure the quality of their referrals. Â¶ Another UW YWCA program centered on women's health. Aradia Clinic opened in 1972 after a year of organizing. The clinic was built by over sixty women under the leadership of a female architect. Aradia strongly encouraged patients to take their health into their own hands. Aradia staff offered annual examinations, pregnancy detection and counselling , and other medical services, as well as self-health classes, workshops, and abortion procedures. In 1973, Aradia sponsored the Third World Women Family Planning Needs Assessment Project. Several community groups, including EI Centro de la Raza and Planned Parenthood, encouraged Aradia to research the need for family planning services within Seattle's ethnic communities. The project's objective was to determine what family planning services were needed and how those needs could be met. Information was gathered from family planning clinics, ethnic service centers, and a sampling of women from each community. The report was completed in 1974 and included extensive demographic material and a list of recommendations. In 1973, Aradia legally separated from the YWCA in order to release the Board of Directors from responsibility for Aradia's actions, although it continued to be housed in the UW YWCA building until 1978. As of 2005, it operates as the Aradia Women's Health Center, and has remained committed to providing feminist health care for women. Â¶ The Lesbian Resource Center began as the Gay Women's Resource Center in 1971 after a UW YWCA staff member took a course on homosexuality at the UW Experimental College and recognized a need in the community. The LRC was a peer counseling center that prpvidea support services to lesbians in the Seattle-King County area. As well as providing individual counseling , a lending library, and a speaker's bureau, discussion \""rap\"" groups were offered. The LRC also worked to make changes within the UW YWCA, pushing for more lesbian membership on the Board of Directors. The LRC became independent from the UW YWCA in 1980. It gained non-profit status under the name Pacific Women's Resources but continued to offer services as the LRC. As of 2005, the LRC is still active in Seattle. Â¶ Mechanica began as a women's co-operative garage and auto mechanics course in 1972. By 1975, it had evolved into a skilled trades information service for women seeking to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades and other nontraditional jobs. As well as providing job counseling , Mechanica staff promoted affirmative action hiring of women and ethnic minorities and pushed for affirmative action placements in union apprenticeships. They worked hard to persuade the University of Washington to adopt a 12% goal for women on UW construction sites. Off campus, Mechanica worked as a consultant to the City of Seattle and King County to help them reach affirmative action goals. It also worked with Federal Contract Compliance officers to push local private companies to hire women. Mechanica lost funding in1980, and the program was converted into a Women's Employment Service. Â¶ Women in Trades (WIT) emerged out of Mechanica as an advocacy group for equal employment opportunites for women and people of color in the trades. In operation by 1976, WIT was an organization of working women employed in bluecollar jobs in the production, maintenance, and construction industries. They were dedicated to establishing legal action for the enforcement of affirmative action goals on a local and national level. Together with Mechanica, WIT negotiated with the Port of Seattle and local unions to ensure they met affirmative action hiring guidelines. WIT also offered support groups and legal support for tradeswomen . WIT was defunct by 1979, but the annual Women in Trades Fair started by Mechanica in 1979 still continues. Â¶ Rape Relief was formed in 1972 following a speakout on rape on the UW campus. Rape Relief provided a 24-hour crisis line for victims of sexual assault and their allies, as well as medical and legal advocacy . Rape Relief staff promoted community education about rape by speaking to junior high and high school students, as well as to various adult community groups. Projects designed for developmentally disabled people, ethnic communities and non-English speaking victims were created. Rape Relief also conducted sensitivity training for police in Washington, Oregon and Alaska . Rape Relief became independent in 1980 and continued to operate as Seattle Rape Relief until financial problems forced its closure in 1999. Â¶ Serve Our Sisters (SOS) was formed in 1970 by two Seattle feminists and was modeled on a temporary, feminist, emergency housing service for women in crisis in New York City. In 1972, SOS became part of the UW YWCA, obtaining a much-needed central telephone. SOS provided women with housing, referrals, a telephone crisis line, and emotional support. Local referral agencies, such as the Open Door Clinic and Harborview Emergency Room, also used SOS's services. By 1974, SOS was no longer an active. Â¶ The Third World Women's Resource Center opened in the summer of 1973 as part of the UW YWCA's attempt to implement the One Imperative to Eliminate Racism. The One Imperative was a National YWCA policy which pushed for \""the elimination of racism wherever it exists and by any means necessary.\"" One of the main purposes of the Center was to provide educational material for all women struggling with the intersections of racism, sexism and economic oppression. The Center was developed and coordinated by Third World women, or women of color. Counseling, classes, rap groups, a library, a speaker's bureau, and a referral service were offered, and there were also efforts to interact with incarcerated women of color. The Center was no longer active by 1976. The failure of the UW YWCA to implement the One Imperative successfully caused tension among staff and Board members. Â¶ Women in Midstream (WI M) was started as the Ad-Hoc Committee on Menopause in 1972 by several middle-aged women who served on the Board of Directors and saw the need for a program dedicated to older women's health, particularly on the topic of menopause. WIM sent out questionnaires about women's personal experiences dealing with symptoms, treatments and the medical field. Due to a small amount of unexpected national publicity, women from around the United States participated and looked to WIM as a resource on menopause. A WIM volunteer, Jane Page wrote a book The Other Awkward Age utilizing the questionnaire results and contributing a much-needed woman's perspective on menopause. WIM was no longer in operation by 1979. Â¶ Women's Divorce Cooperative (WDC) began operating in 1971 as a cooperative of women interested in learning more about divorce law and how to file for divorce without hiring a lawyer. The WDC became an official UW YWCA program in 1975. In its early years, WDC volunteers provided sessions in pro se divorce procedures, as well as referrals to lawyers, counselors, and other agencies for further help in securing a divorce. Telephone and in-person counseling were also available to help women cope emotionally with a divorce. The WDC separated from the UW YWCA in 1980 to regain financial control and restore a cooperative philosophy. Â¶ The feminist spirit inherent in the UW YWCA's programming can also be seen in internal organizational changes. In the two years following its independence from the UW YMCA, the staff structure shifted from a hierarchical to a co-director model, in which three adminstrators received equal pay. The Co-Directorship was seen as a more egalitarian power structure. Evaluation of the model began in 1975, and in 1976, the Board of Directors voted to return to an Executive Coordinator model. The Executive Coordinator was responsible for agency supervision, staff development and supervision , fiscal management, liasion with the Board, and coordination with the community services. Many staff members were displeased with the restructuring; some did not feel included in the decision-making process and others did not believe the model fit into a feminist organiza tion. Â¶ In 1980, the UW YWCA was evicted from University Way and moved away from the UW campus to Northlake. They remained at 701 NE Northlake Way until 1988 and continued to \""struggle for peace and justice, freedom and dignity for all people ,\"" as stated by the National YWCA purpose. The UW YWCA was still active in 1995 on the UW campus, though they may have become defunct as early as 1996. Â¶ "

1885-002,"Paul, William Lewis, 1885-1977",William Lewis Paul papers,"William Lewis Paul (1885-1977) was a pioneering Indian rights attorney and a leading figure in the campaign for native Alaskan rights. Paul was born in 1885 to parents who both had Tlingit mothers and European fathers. His mother, Matilda Kinnan Paul (Tamaree), was a Presbyterian missionary who worked at the Sitka Industrial Training School. Paul was educated at this school and later at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. He adopted the Carlisle School's assimilationist ideals and its assertion that Indians should have the same rights and privileges as other American citizens. Paul later graduated from Whitworth College in Spokane and studied law through correspondence courses offered by LaSalle University. In 1920 he returned to Alaska. His brother Louis was Grand Secretary of the Alaska Native Brotherhood (ANB), and he convinced William to stay in Alaska and work for the ANB. Â¶ The Paul brothers dominated the ANB from 1920 to 1940. William was elected Grand Secretary in 1920, the same year he passed the bar, making him the first Alaska native attorney. The ANB re-elected him Grand Secretary in 1921, 1922, 1935, 1938, and 1951. He won the office of Grand President in 1928, 1929, and 1955. Louis served as Grand Secretary twice and as Grand President three times between 1919 and 1939. The ANB, founded in 1912 by Tlingit Presbyterians associated with the Sitka Industrial Training School, originally saw its mission as civilizing the Indians of Southeast Alaska. In 1915 the ANB successfully lobbied the territorial legislature to pass a law giving citizenship and voting rights to natives who learned English and held jobs in the cash economy. The Pauls retained the ANB's focus on assimilating and Christianizing Indians. They argued, however, that Alaska natives were already US citizens by birth, and were therefore entitled to the rights and privileges associated with citizenship. The district court finally adopted this position in 1922, when William Paul successfully defended the right of his brother's father-in-law to vote in US vs. Charlie Jones. Â¶ William Paul made the ANB a major force in Alaskan politics. He spent much of the early 1920s organizing new ANB chapters throughout southeast Alaska, boosting membership from 100 in 1920 to 2,200 by 1935. He also started and edited a newspaper, Alaska Fisherman, published in Ketchikan from 1923 to 1932. The paper devoted much of its space to denouncing white cannery owners who monopolized native fishing grounds. William Paul used his newspaper and his ANB connections to great advantage in his successful 1924 and 1926 campaigns for the Alaska legislature, becoming the first native Alaskan to serve in that body. He passed a bill that made Alaska natives eligible to receive assistance under the territory's widows, orphans, and old age pension laws. Paul also fended off a challenge to native voting rights in the form of a literacy test. The law passed, but Paul amended it to exclude from its provisions all those who had previously voted. Without this amendment, the literacy test would have disenfranchised most of the native population. Charges that Paul accepted campaign contributions from canneries cost him his bid for re-election in 1928. He also lost his campaigns for territorial attorney general in 1930 and 1932. Nonetheless, Paul continued his successful private law practice. He tried many Indian rights cases, including one that forced the Ketchikan public schools to accept Indian children in 1929. Â¶ In the mid 1930s, William Paul worked for the ANB in Washington, DC. He authored a bill that allowed the Tlingit and Haida Indians to sue the government in a test case to determine the validity of their land claims; Congress passed this law in 1935. Paul was also instrumental in extending the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) to Alaska in 1936. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) then hired Paul to help villages draft IRA constitutions. Paul, however, suffered several setbacks in the late 1930s. In 1937 the Alaska Bar Association prohibited Paul from practicing law on the grounds that he had defrauded a client. The BIA fired Paul shortly thereafter. Â¶ The ANB was divided sharply over whether to allow William Paul a major role in planning the Tlingit-Haida land claims suit. Paul would not be readmitted to the Bar until January 1959. His disbarment reduced his influence in the ANB, which turned to the rival Peratrovich family for leadership. Nonetheless, the BIA required the Haida and Tlingit to form a joint council to decide how to prosecute the suit and how to distribute the benefits, and Paul was elected head of this council in 1941. The Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska (CCTHITA), founded in 1935, became one of the leading organizations campaigning for native Alaskan rights from the 1940s onwards. Paul's two sons, William Lackey Paul (often referred to as William L. Paul, Jr.) and Louis Frederick Paul (known as Fred Paul), were designated attorneys for the case against the government. The BIA and the Peratroviches removed the Pauls from the case in 1944, hiring instead the nationally known attorney James Curry. Â¶ William Paul dissented from Curry's contention that the Tlingit and Haida were distinct tribal groups whose land holdings had been usurped by whites. Paul argued that the â€˜Tlingit' and â€˜Haida', as represented by the CCTHIA, reflected linguistic rather than tribal groupings. He believed that class action for Native lands claims must be brought by individual tribes rather than the CCTHIA. Paul helped BIA Commissioner Dillon Meyer remove Curry from the case in 1953, forcing the Tlingit and Haida to hire attorney Israel Weissbrodt. Meanwhile, Paul and his sons, despite great opposition from the ANB, brought a series of cases designed to force the courts to accept Paul's theories about the Haida and Tlingit claims. The cases culminated with Tee-Hit-Ton vs. US (1955). The Supreme Court stated that compensation could not be awarded for Native Land Claims unless recognized specifically by Congress, and rejected Paul's theory about the Tlingit and Haida. The CCTHIA was later re-organized, however, in order to reflect more accurately tribal structures in Southeast Alaska. Although considered a setback for Native rights, the Tee-Hit-Ton case did not end the Tlingit-Haida Land Claims action. The Court of Claims ruled in 1959 that the Tlingit and Haida had occupied and owned the entire area of southeast Alaska at the time the state was purchased by the US in 1867. Compensation of $7.5 million was awarded to the CCTHIA in 1968. Organizations including the ANB and the Alaska Federation of Natives International would continue meanwhile to campaign for Native land claim settlements across Alaska. Â¶ Paul moved to Seattle following the Tee-Hit-Ton case, and became gradually less active within the ANB. He adopted the role of an advisor rather than a leader within the organization. He frequently sent open letters to the ANB membership that set out his goals for the organization and his opinions of its leaders' policies. Although he was not active in the passage of the landmark 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, his sons were and corresponded with him on the matter. The settlement awarded both land and compensation to Alaskan Natives, to be administered by twelve regional corporations within the state and one outside. Paul would remain involved with Native rights issues and organizations through the final years of his life. He practiced law as late as 1972, and paid active dues to the Alaska Bar Association until 1974. William Lewis Paul died in 1977. Â¶ "
0089-002,"Thomson, Reginald Heber, 1856-1949",Microfilm of Reginald Thomson's letterpress books,"<p>Reginald Heber Thomson (1856-1949), a Seattle civil engineer, official, and consultant, is credited with establishing much of the municipal infrastructure of the fledgling city of Seattle. Thomson was Seattle city engineer from 1892 through 1911 and again in 1930 and 1931. He chaired the Seattle Public Works Board 1896-1911, established the Port of Seattle in 1911, served as superintendent of Stathcona Park, Vancouver Island, from 1912 to 1915, and was a member of the Seattle City Council from 1916 to 1922. Thomson consulted on major water and hydroelectric projects in Washington, Oregon, British Columbia, and Alaska. Among the many projects he is known for are several major regrades of Seattle's business district and waterfront, the establishment of Seattle's first hydroelectic plants, and establishment of the Cedar River water supply and the West Point sewage treatment plant.</p>
		<p>Early in his career, Thomson entered into a partnership with F. H. Whitworth, the city and county surveyor. One of Thomsonâ€™s early tasks as assistant surveyor involved the initial work of dredging a canal between Lake Washington and Lake Union where, decades later, he would be instrumental in constructing the Lake Washington Ship Canal connecting both lakes to Puget Sound. In 1884, Thomson became the city surveyor. In this role he built Seattleâ€™s first sewers and the Grant Street bridge across the tideflats. He resigned in 1886 to work for the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern railroad. As locating engineer, he plotted the path of the railbed from the northern end of Lake Washington all the way eastward through Snoqualmie Pass, to Lake Keechelus. Not stopping there, he moved on to Spokane for a few years where he constructed terminals and built two bridges. Once back in Seattle, he worked as a consulting engineer. Then, in 1892 he became city engineer, a job that he would hold for the next 20 years. He added 4.5 miles of sewer lines throughout the city, much of it through formations that had stymied earlier engineers. He also worked on creating the growing communityâ€™s first sidewalks and paved roads, including Lake Washington Boulevard, which he and his assistant, George F. Cotterill (1865-1958), first designed as a cinder path for bicycles.</p>
		<p>His first regrade, in 1898, was up 1st Avenue from Pike Street to Denny Way. Five years later, Pike and Pine were regraded from 2nd Avenue to Broadway. For the next eight years, Thomsonâ€™s crews pummeled Denny Hill, between 2nd and 5th Avenues, and Pike Street and Denny Way. Thomson also went after the hillock between Main and Judkins Streets and 4th and 12th Avenues. Dearborn Street was regraded, and the 12th Avenue Bridge was built to Beacon hill. He created Westlake Avenue, which provided level access to Lake Union. In all, Seattle regraded 25 miles of streets, which displaced 16 million cubic yards of dirt. This dirt was poured into the tideflats south of the city, the landfill creating a whole new industrial section for the burgeoning metropolis. When James J. Hill (1838-1916), owner of the Great Northern Railroad, established his terminus in Seattle, Thomson convinced him to bypass the waterfront's already crowded Railroad Avenue (now Alaskan Way) and establish King Street Station south of Pioneer Square. Thomson had a tunnel built beneath the city from Virginia to Washington Streets, which was leted in 1906.</p>
		<p>Seattle used to get water from a reservoir on Beacon Hill filled with water pumped from Lake Washington, but as the city grew, this system became woefully inadequate. Thomson looked towards the Cedar River Watershed as a source of freshwater for Seattle residents, located 30 miles southeast of Seattle in the foothills of the Cascade mountain range. By 1899, work on the pipeline had begun in earnest. On December 24, 1900, a test was made of the water flow to look for leaks. The system worked well enough that on January 10, 1901, water began flowing into the Volunteer Park reservoir in Seattle. More than a century later, Seattle and King County still use the Cedar River watershed.</p>
		<p>Thomson and his crew designed and built the City Light Cedar Falls hydroelectric plant, which went into operation on October 4, 1904. On January 10, 1905, electric current illuminated streetlights in Seattle, and by September 9, City Light began serving private customers, which it does to this day. At the urging of the city council, Thomson was asked to take a well-deserved vacation from all of his good work. He visited Europe, where he â€œmade examination of nearly everything connected with city life, such as water, lights, sewers, conditions accelerating city growth, citiesâ€™ fire control, municipal baths, municipal laundries, and so forth.â€</p>
		<p>From 1905 to 1915 Thomson also became president of the University of Washingtonâ€™s board of managers. During this time he also examined the flow of commerce along Seattleâ€™s waterways. This interested him so much, that he resigned as city engineer in 1911 to organize the Port of Seattle, established largely through his efforts at lobbying the state legislature. Under Thomson's direction as engineer, the Port Commission made far reaching developmental plans, many of which are still in effect. While on the commission, Thomson pushed for acquisition of Smith Cove and the foot of Bell Street for use by the Port. He advocated deepening and straightening the Duwamish River for use in the industrial area, and also campaigned in Washington D.C., for funds to build the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks.</p>
		<p>From 1916 to 1922, he was a member of the Seattle City Council, yet he continued to do engineering work. He was a consultant on the Rogue River Valley Irrigation canal, and built a hydroelectric plant in Eugene, Oregon. He was in charge of water development in Bellingham. He surveyed power-plant sites in Southeastern Alaska. He returned, temporarily, to his job as Seattle city engineer in 1930 to oversee the final work on the Diablo Dam on the Skagit River. After that, he was a consulting engineer for both the Wenatchee Metropolitan Water System and the Inter-County River Improvement Commission for Pierce and King counties. He also consulted on the construction of the Lake Washington Floating Bridge and for the foundations of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Reginald Thomson died on January 7, 1949, at the age of 92. Immediately prior to his death, he wrote his autobiography, That Man Thomson (published posthumously). </p>"

Through its mission \""to protect, restore, and sustain Washington's environment for all,\"" the organization has served as a coordinating body on issues of statewide significance. Among other achievements, the WEC has worked to enforce and pass the State Environmental Policy Act, the State Superfund Law, the Growth Management Act, and the Shoreline Management Act. It also operates the Environmental Priorities Coalition and the Voter Education Program. Throughout its history, the organization has also focused on other issues related to carbon pollution, clean energy, water pollution, forests, and public lands.Â¶ In 1986 and 1987, the WEC was heavily involved with the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Implementation Project, which was the result of negotiations between the timber industry, the four natural resource agencies in Washington State, Indian tribes, and environmentalists. The Project is a cooperative plan for managing forest harvest practices on both state and private timberlands. Marcy Golde was involved with the negotiations, while Lisa Lombardy served as the WEC's statewide coordinator. Other WEC staff, through private funding, monitored timber harvest applications.Â¶ Another major legal case in which the WEC was involved concerned Washington State rules that imposed requirements on the design, equipment, reporting, and operations of oil tankers. Washington State, with the help of the WEC, defeated the trade association Intertanko, which represented operators of oil tanker ships. In 2000, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision on the basis that federal law pre-empts state rules. Â¶ "

1744-001,Pope & Talbot Lumber Co,Pope & Talbot Lumber Company records,"Lumber company.Â¶ Established 1849 by Andrew J. Pope and William D. Talbot in San Francisco and Port Gamble, Washington. Based in San Francisco with subsidiaries in the Pacific Northwest."
,Pope & Talbot,,"Andrew Jackson Pope and Captain William Talbot, both from families who owned sawmills in Maine, founded the Pope & Talbot Company shortly after they arrived in San Francisco in 1849. The pair had come to gold rush San Francisco to sell lumber that had been cut on the East Coast and shipped around Cape Horn. It soon became evident, however, that transportation costs severely cut into the profits of this venture. They thus decided to build a sawmill at Port Gamble. When the mill opened in 1853, it was only the fourth mill on Puget Sound. Pope & Talbot created a subsidiary, the Puget Mill Company, to run the mill.

Although its mill was not as large as Captain William Rentonâ€™s Port Blakely mill, the Puget Mill Company still grew to be the most profitable lumber firm on the Sound. The company built another mill at Port Gamble in 1856, bought additional mills at Utsalady in 1877 and at Port Ludlow in 1878, and acquired several sailing ships throughout the nineteenth century. The Pope & Talbot companies owed a great deal of their prosperity to their expert administration. William Talbot had wisely picked the talented Cyrus Walker and Edwin Ames to manage operations on Puget Sound (see the guide to the Edwin G. Ames papers for more detail). Talbot also adopted a modern organizational structure with many specialized subsidiaries and instituted modern accounting procedures well before any other firm in the industry.

Pope & Talbot was able to weather depressions because of its ownersâ€™ policy of borrowing money only from family members and because of the companyâ€™s diverse market base. Pope & Talbot was more adventurous and more successful than other companies trying to enter foreign markets. For many years the company had a virtual monopoly on the lumber trade with Hawaii. In addition, Talbot and Pope built good relations with lumber yards throughout California. When competition in California became too fierce, Pope & Talbot took the leading role in organizing the Pacific Pine Lumber Company, a cooperative effort to fix prices, set production quotas, and divide up the lucrative California market. Pacific Pine lasted only from 1886 to 1897 and never functioned particularly well as a cartel, but it still postponed the time when Pope & Talbot lost its strong position in the California market.

The completion of the Northern Pacific line to Tacoma in 1887 did not immediately impact Pope & Talbot. In the 1890s, however, when railroad rates fell and when lumbermen from the Great Lakes states moved into the Northwest, Pope & Talbot saw its profits shrink. Talbot had selected the companyâ€™s mill sites because of their excellent harbors. Unfortunately, this left the Pope & Talbot mills, all located on the west side of Puget Sound, miles from a major rail line and thus unable to compete in the vast markets east of the Cascades. The company also faced increasing competition in its overseas markets.

Pope & Talbot began hiring its own logging crews and cutting its own land to avoid buying high-priced logs from independent companies in the early twentieth century. This policy, coupled with sales of logged-off lands between Seattle and Everett, kept the company afloat but never really overcame the advantages held by the newer, rail-oriented mills. The Talbot and Pope families sold their companies to the Charles McCormick Lumber Company in 1925. McCormick quickly ran into financial trouble, causing the Talbot and Pope families to resume management in 1929. When McCormick failed to meet his payments, Pope & Talbot re-acquired its former holdings in 1938.

The rebirth of the Pope & Talbot companies came at an auspicious time. The Second World War massively stimulated the lumber market and also allowed Pope & Talbot, with its fleet of cargo ships, to make a fortune shipping war material to Europe. In the 1940s Pope & Talbot used these profits to construct a huge new mill in Oakridge, Oregon; to buy additional timberlands on the western shore of Puget Sound and in the Oregon Cascades; and to rebuild the Port Gamble mill. This made Port Gamble the home of the longest continuously operating sawmill in North America. Pope & Talbot and its subsidiaries are still major lumber producers and are currently the third largest private timber owners in the Northwest. "
1732-003,North Cascades Conservation Council,North Cascades Conservation Council records,"The North Cascades Conservation Council (NCCC) was organized in 1957 with the mission \""to protect and preserve the North Cascades' scenic, scientific, recreational, educational, and wilderness values.\"" For the next ten years, NCCC was dedicated to its main goal, the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. It was aided by other organizations dedicated to conservation, such as the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. Â¶ Conservation efforts targeting the North Cascades did not begin with NCCC. Concerns about the area were voiced as early as 1892, when a park proposal for Lake Chelan was presented but denounced as being against public interests. In 1937, the first formal proposal for a North Cascades National Park was submitted by the U.S. National Park Service and Owen A. Tomlinson. The proposal was impeded by opposition from the U.S. Forest Service, which had recently lost the battle over the formation of Olympic National Park. Â¶ In the mid-1950s, Grant McConnell, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focused on public land policy, raised the call for an organization to protect the North Cascades. Disturbed by the U.S. Forest Service's plans for timber sales, mining, and construction of a cross-mountain highway over Cascade Pass, McConnell convinced Polly Dyer to call a meeting at her home to discuss the threats to the North Cascades wilderness. McConnell's main objective was the formation of a single-issue conservation group dedicated to the North Cascades. Meeting attendees resisted McConnell's plan, citing the work being done on the issue by the Mountaineers Conservation Division, to which many attendees belonged. The Mountaineers Glacier Peak Subcommitee, chaired by Philip Zalesky, was also praised for its concentration on an important geographic area of the North Cascades. After the meeting, McConnell and other Sierra Club members worked to persuade North Cascades conservation leaders to form an organization. Patrick Goldsworthy was one of those leaders, and he later became the long-time president of NCCC. Â¶ Goldsworthy had proven himself to be a committed Northwest conservationist in the early 1950s. After moving to Seattle in 1952 to accept a research appointment in the University of Washington School of Medicine, he joined the Mountaineers Conservation Division and met John and Polly Dyer. Goldsworthy, together with his wife, Jane, and the Dyers, established the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club in 1954. Â¶ On March 23, 1957, during a Glacier Peak conference in Portland, Oregon, Goldsworthy and others took up the call to protect the North Cascades. Twenty-six people from Washington, Oregon, and California were present for the formation of the North Cascades Conservation Council. NCCC designated its immediate goal as the formation of the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area. Bylaws were written and officers were elected. Philip Zalesky served as president, Pat Goldsworthy as first vice-president, Una Davies as second vice-president, Polly Dyer as secretary, and Yvonne Prater as treasurer. Harvey Manning later joined the group as editor of the NCCC's newsletter. Â¶ With Patrick Goldsworthy serving as leader of both NCCC and the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club, assistance from the national Sierra Club and its executive director, David Brower, was quickly forthcoming. The Sierra Club had begun leading its first outing trips into the North Cascades a year earlier. In 1957, the Sierra Club produced the film, The Wilderness Alps of Stehekin. Publicizing the cause of the North Cascades, the film was shown extensively by the NCCC and other conservation groups. It was also circulated to public officials and members of Congress. Â¶ The Sierra Club furthered its commitment to the Pacific Northwest in 1961 by hiring Michael McCloskey, the first Northwest Conservation representative. The representative was funded by the Federation of the Western Outdoor Clubs and served as a valuable lobbyist and advocate for the formation of national parks and wilderness areas in the Northwest. Â¶ By 1959, support for a North Cascades National Park was strong among conservation organizations, including the NCCC, the National Parks Association, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Cascadians. Conservationists called for the U.S. Forest Service to suspend its plans for timber sales and road construction, and to allow the U.S. National Park Service to conduct a study of the possible park area. Washington Congressman Thomas Pelly, a vocal advocate of conservation, asked the U.S. National Park Service to conduct the study, only to be reprimanded by the director of the U.S. Forest Service for neglecting to ask for permission. Congressman Pelly, with the assistance of the Interior Department and groups such as the NCCC, then attempted to introduce legislation to order the study, but was unsuccessful. Â¶ In 1961, Pelly was presented with a petition bearing 22,000 signatures in favor of a park study. That same year, Washington Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson also joined the debate when they encouraged Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman to develop a forest management plan for the contested areas. Freeman imposed a temporary moratorium on logging, which ended the following year, only to be asked by Pelly to impose a stricter moratorium on logging until a national park study was held. Freeman denied the request, since the U.S. Forest Service had completed a high mountain management policy for the North Cascades. Â¶ In 1963, after disputes between the U.S. Park and Forest Services were settled, a joint study of the North Cascades was announced. The study was recommended by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, and the study team was chaired by the director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Edward C. Crafts. Public hearings to introduce the study were held in Seattle, Wenatchee, and Mount Vernon. The NCCC worked diligently to ensure a majority of oral and written statements in support of park establishment. The NCCC also submitted a comprehensive 120-page plan for the park, entitled Prospectus for a North Cascades National Park. The Prospectus confirmed the NCCC's leadership in the park campaign. Â¶ The study team's report, The North Cascades, was published in October 1965, recommending the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. The Sierra Club published the influential book, The Wild Cascades: Forgotten Parkland, in 1965 as well, to draw further attention to the area. Public hearings were held in 1966 to discuss the study team's findings. On March 20, 1967, Senators Jackson and Magnuson introduced Senate Bill 1321, which established the North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The bill was passed in November, and the following year, in October 1968, the North Cascades National Park Service Complex was created by an act of Congress. Â¶ Another long struggle to which the NCCC was committed was passing the Wilderness Act. The legislative effort began in 1956 as a wilderness bill drafted by Howard Zahniser, director of the Wilderness Society. The bill called for the conservation of the nation's remaining wilderness. Despite initial opposition and numerous revisions, the Wilderness Act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. The act created the National Wilderness Preservation System and put 9.1 million acres of national forest land into the new system. It was the first wilderness protection legislation passed in the world. Â¶ The first major crisis to occur under the Wilderness Act began in 1967 with Kennecott Copper Corporation's plan to create an open-pit mine in Miners Ridge, a location inside the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area and close to Image Lake. Since Kennecott owned the mineral rights to the land, the Wilderness Act's clause regarding private ownership seemed to protect the mine's development. Under pressure from tremendous publicity and opposition by the NCCC and Washington congressmen, Kennecott decided to postpone its plans, although talk of commencing mining operations resumed in 1969 when copper prices soared. The land was later bought from Kennecott and the area protected from commercial interests. Â¶ The NCCC also participated in the debate over roadways in national parks. The Park Service program launched Mission 66 in 1956 to improve deteriorating and dangerous conditions in the national parks that largely resulted from a massive boom in visitors after World War II. Mission 66 expanded visitor capacity in the national parks to accommodate an estimated eighty million automobile tourists within ten years. The program called for adding more overnight accommodations, building visitor centers, and constructing park roads. The roadway debate continued in 1957, when the Washington State legislature authorized a survey for a cross-Cascades highway. On September 2, 1972, the highway, known as the North Cascades Highway, officially opened, to the dismay of NCCC members. Another debate began in 1961 regarding the Outdoor Advertising Act, which established billboard control along scenic highways. The NCCC called for more aggressive controls and restrictions of outdoor advertising than the controversial act established in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the Northwest. Â¶ Over the past third of a century, the NCCC has accomplished much in conservation, including the creation of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Glacier Peak Wilderness, William O. Douglas Wilderness (Cougar Lakes Wilderness Area), Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Mt. Baker Wilderness, Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, and others. The NCCC has also collaborated with British Columbia allies to block the raising of Ross Dam and to encourage the establishment of a U.S.-Canadian international park. In addition, the NCCC newsletter, The Wild Cascades, has kept its members and other conservationists informed of and dedicated to the various issues affecting the North Cascades. The North Cascades Conservation Council has been a leader in the protection and preservation of the North Cascades mountain range from the Columbia River to the U.S.-Canadian border. Â¶ "

In 1932, in reponse to the growing need for the cooperation and coordination of these clubs, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs (FWOC) was organized\"" (from FWOC pamphlet). Â¶ This coalition of hiking and outdoor recreation groups works to promote environmental conservation in the eight western states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, as well as Alaska and Western Canada. Annual conventions, held primarily in California, Oregon, and Washington, have been held by FWOC since 1932, gathering delegates from member clubs to decide federation positions on conservation issues. Resolutions are submitted during and before each conference by members and club officials. The official resolutions are subsequently used to urge legislators, public officials, and private bodies to work for conservation goals. Annual reports are submitted by the federation's elected officials, and FWOC has also kept member clubs informed about new developments in the preservation of the West's natural resources through an annual periodical. Published as Western Outdoor Quarterly from 1933 to 1969, and then as Western Outdoors Annual from 1970 to 1975, Outdoors West continues as FWOC's official publication. Â¶ FWOC's mission is to create a strong regional alliance of organizations dedicated to environmental protection. Working together, member clubs helped secure passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. They made important contributions to the establishment of the North Cascades National Park and the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in Washington State, as well as to the establishment of various wilderness areas in the national forests of Oregon and California. FWOC also helped to ensure the establishment of a national monument in the Sierra Nevada range to protect the remaining Giant Sequoia trees. Â¶ For some twenty years, FWOC shared a Northwest conservation representative with the Sierra Club to ensure further representation of the area's conservation goals. Michael McCloskey was first to hold the position (1961-1964), followed by Rodger Pegues (1964-1967). Brock Evans held the position from 1967 until 1973, when he became the Washington, D.C. representative. Roger Mellem was the acting Northwest conservation representative for 1973. Doug Scott continued the position until 1978, followed by the last representative, Jim Blomquist (1978-1980). The representative's main duty was to lobby for Northwest conservation through testimony at related hearings and through extensive correspondence with interested parties. Â¶ "

Throughout its history, the organization has also focused on other issues related to carbon pollution, clean energy, water pollution, forests, and public lands.Â¶ In 1986 and 1987, the WEC was heavily involved with the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Implementation Project, which was the result of negotiations between the timber industry, the four natural resource agencies in Washington State, Indian tribes, and environmentalists. The Project is a cooperative plan for managing forest harvest practices on both state and private timberlands. Marcy Golde was involved with the negotiations, while Lisa Lombardy served as the WEC's statewide coordinator. Other WEC staff, through private funding, monitored timber harvest applications.Â¶ Another major legal case in which the WEC was involved concerned Washington State rules that imposed requirements on the design, equipment, reporting, and operations of oil tankers. Washington State, with the help of the WEC, defeated the trade association Intertanko, which represented operators of oil tanker ships. In 2000, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision on the basis that federal law pre-empts state rules. Â¶ "

1776-018,"Evans, Brock, 1937-",Brock Evans campaign files,"Brock Evans' career as a leader in the environmental movement began in the mid-1960's. He has held prominent positions in numerous environmental organizations. Evans represents the branch of the movement that believes in achieving environmental goals by changing government policy through political give and take, litigation, and legislative lobbying. Â¶ Evans served as the Northwest representative of the Sierra Club and of the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs from 1967 to 1973, as acting director and director of the Washington D.C. office of the Sierra Club from 1973 to 1981, and as vice president for national issues for the National Audubon Society from 1981 to 1996. Evans also was the Audubon representative to the Ancient Forest Alliance circa 1988 to 1994. He also served on the board of a number of other environmental organizations, including the League of Conservation Voters and the Environmental Law Institute and the North Cascades Conservation Council. Most recently he has served as President of the Endangered Species Coalition Â¶ Born in 1937 in Columbus, Ohio, Evans earned his B.A. from Princeton in 1959. He spent two years in the U.S. Marine Corps and then earned his law degree at the University of Michigan while serving in the reserve of the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1963 Evans moved to Seattle and worked in a private law practice until his career changed course in the late 1960's. In 1966 while hiking in one of his favorite areas Evans encountered signs indicating that the ancient trees there were about to be logged. Infuriated by the impending loss of this forest, he left his private law practice and dedicated himself full-time to fighting environmental destruction. Â¶ Within very little time, Evans established himself as one of the leading environmentalists in the Pacific Northwest. From 1967 to 1973 he was the Northwest Representative for the Sierra Club and represented the Audubon Society through the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. As the Sierra Club Representative, he also was a co-founder of the Washington Environmental Council in 1968. During this time He became heavily active in state and regional environmental issues during this time. He organized citizen support and was the primary lobbyist in Washington State during the final crucial years when legislation was being formulated to establish North Cascades National Park. He led efforts to ensure that key parcels were included in the Pasayten and Glacier Peak Wilderness areas. His efforts led to renewed strength for campaigns to gain wilderness protection for the Alpine Lakes and other unprotected regions in the Cascades. In 1972 he received the Environmentalist of the Year award from the Washington Environmental Council. Â¶ In 1973, Evans moved into the national arena when he was named Director of the Sierra Club's Washington, D.C. office. In this position he lobbied Congress as well as administrative agencies, state and local governments, and other organizations on a wide range of environmental issues. Preserving Hell's Canyon was one of the major issues during his time at the Sierra Club. Private and public utility companies had wanted to dam this 100 mile stretch of Idaho's Snake River for over two decades, but had been unable to do so because of disputes about who would build and control the dam. In the 1970's, these energy interests came together and appeared able and willing to cooperate enough to undertake the project, but Evans set a historic precedent by filing the first environmental lawsuit in the Northwest against the dams. Then he, along with other environmentalists, successfully lobbied for federal legislation in 1975 that prevented any dam construction, legislation that Evans drafted himself. Â¶ During his time with the Sierra Club, Evans continued to gain a higher profile and a reputation as an outstanding lobbyist and leader. In 1977, U.S. News and World Report named him one of the most influential lobbyists in Washington, D.C., as did Fortune in 1982, showing not only his own strength, but the lobbying strength and legitimacy that environmentalists had gained. During this time he also served on the Environmental Advisory Board of the Army Corps of Engineers. Â¶ In 1981, Evans became the National Audubon Society's Vice-President for National Issues where he remained until 1996. During his career with the Audubon Society, the preservation of old growth forests in the Pacific Northwest was a major focus for Evans, as it had been throughout his career as an environmental advocate. Evans feared that timber companies were logging old growth forests too quickly and that the nation's ancient forests would soon be gone if nothing were changed. He believed that the ancient forest ecosystem could not be preserved by clear cutting patches of trees, as the Forest Service allowed timber companies to do. Â¶ Many of Evans's efforts to save ancient forests involved lobbying Congress, which had the power to change Forest Service policies and increase or limit logging in specific areas. In the mid 1980's, Evans and the Audubon Society directed much of their lobbying efforts toward Congressional appropriations committees, but met with only limited success. Evans and the Audubon Society then changed their strategy and teamed up with other environmental organizations to form the Ancient Forest Alliance. One of the coalition's new strategies involved focusing on the enforcement of existing laws to preserve forests, and the spotted owl soon became a central component of this strategy. The number of spotted owls was declining significantly because of logging in old growth forests. Environmentalists and biologists believed that the spotted owl was a \""management indicator species\"" and that its fortune was an indicator of the entire group of species in the old growth forests. For people such as Evans, the demise of this animal bolstered their belief in the importance of preserving the ancient forest ecosystem, but the owl's demise also gave them a new opportunity to prevent future logging. Because of the federal Endangered Species Act, which mandated the preservation of ecosystems that supported endangered species, classifying the owl as endangered would prevent logging in areas where they existed. However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was reluctant to list the owl as endangered, which Evans and others alleged was a result of timber industry influence and not because of scientific research. Because of environmentalists' litigious efforts, the federal courts in 1990 forced the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the spotted owl as \""threatened\"" and issued an injunction forbidding further habitatae destruction. These decisions were major victories for environmentalists and ended logging in many areas of ancient forests where spotted owls were believed to live. Â¶ Despite this victory, political battles over ancient forests continued between environmentalists and logging interests. Evans and others tried to press for more protected areas while logging interests tried to portray environmentalists as people who cared more about spotted owls than about loggers and the communities that depended on the timber industry. In 1993, the newly elected president Bill Clinton called a forest summit in Portland, Oregon to try to find compromise between logging interest and environmentalists. As a leader of one of the largest environmental organizations, Evans participated in the summit. Â¶ Another major issue for Evans during his time with the Audubon Society was the preservation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), located along the northern coast of Alaska. In the late 1980's, oil interest believed that there might be huge oil reserves in the Refuge but needed special legislation to open it to drilling. In 1989, a bill to allow drilling in the ANWR was about to pass through Congress when it suddenly was shelved because of the anti-oil backlash after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Nonetheless, legislation to open the refuge continued to surface in the early 1990's, but Evans, along with other environmentalists, was able to block its passage through Congress. After 1992, bills to open the refuge did pass through Congress on more than one occasion, but with President Clinton sure to veto such legislation, Evans and other environmentalists gave the issue less attention. Â¶ Throughout most of his environmental career, Evans took a pragmatic approach to conservation and at times received harsh criticism from those who said he was willing to compromise. This tension was often evident between local grassroots organizations, including chapters of the Audubon Society, and D.C.-based groups such as the Sierra Club and Audubon offices that Evans helped guide. However, on at least on occasion, Evans took a militant stance when he, along with a former U.S. Representative, Jim Jontz, and other environmental activists, was arrested in 1995 for blocking a logging road in Oregon's Siskiyou National Forest. Evans was protesting what was known as the \""Salvage Rider\"" that allowed tree cutting but had passed into law only because it was attached to an important piece of unrelated legislation. Â¶ During his time with the Audubon Society, Evans continued to undertake many activities both related and unrelated to the society's work. In 1984, he ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives from Washington's first congressional district. In the mid 1980's, he helped found and served on the Board of Directors of the Coast Alliance, an organization that tried to influence the government's coastal zone management plans. From 1985 until 1991, Evans was the Washington, D.C. representative of the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, and from 1989 to 1991 was on the Board of Directors of the Boundary Waters Wilderness Foundation. The Foundation raised funds and tried to expand the Boundary Waters Wilderness, as well as outlaw the use of motor vehicles for portaging. Throughout much of the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's, Evans was on the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation voters and chaired its Political Strategy Committee. For the League, Evans helped review and choose political candidates for the group's endorsements. From 1989 to 1994, he was also on the Board of Directors of the Environmental Law Institute, a think tank for members of the American Environmental Bar. Evans also was a board member for RESTORE: The North Woods, a grassroots organization that pushed for forestland protection in the North Woods eco region (a region extending over the northern tier of states from Maine to Minnesota). He also served on the Steering Committee of the Environmental Coalition for North America in the late l980's. Â¶ The overlapping issues of race and the environmental activism surfaced many times during Evans's career. From 1984 to 1991 he was a board member for the Human Environment Center, an organization that tried to bridge the gap between mostly white, middle-class environmentalists, and underprivileged minorities who typically had little involvement in the movement. The Center focused largely on the environmental problems of the cities, especially those that affected mostly poor minority groups, and tried to get minorities more involved in environmental issues. In the early 1990's, the issue of race and environment again took center stage when Evans helped found the Green Wave Movement. The Movement's goal was \""to restore American life and the American continent\"" and creates \""the foundation of a new green society based on the principles of environmental justice and a sustainable economy.\"" However, the group became divided over internal issues, mostly focusing on the homogeneity of its leaders, which critics believed was paradigmatic of the environmental movement as a whole. For Evans, it was a difficult and frustrating experience and he stepped down from the Steering Committee to open a position for someone other than a white male. Â¶ After retiring as Vice-President for the Audubon Society in 1996, Evans remained in Washington, D.C. as a lobbying consultant and in this capacity has continued working for environmental groups. In 1997 Evans became President of the Endangered Species Coalition in Washington, D.C. The Coalition is an association of 450 environmental, scientific, and religious groups dedicated to protecting and strengthening the Endangered Species Act. Â¶ "

0001-006,Port Blakely Mill Company,Port Blakely Mill Company records,"Lumber mill.Â¶ At its height, the Port Blakely Mill Company was the largest on the Pacific Coast, and possibly in the entire world. Captain William Renton founded it in 1863 on Bainbridge Island, directly across from Seattle in the Puget Sound. Within a year the mill was turning out 50,000 board feet a day. The PBMCo expanded rapidly, as did the timber industry in Washington territory generally. (In the 1880s, the territory's annual timber production soared from 160 million board feet to over a billion). Although the California market was the most crucial, the PBMCo shipped its lumber throughout the Pacific Rim. The PBMCo briefly tried to enter the European market, but the long voyage around South America posed too great of a logistical challenge for consistent shipments to Europe. Â¶ In 1876, Renton incorporated the company in San Francisco with new partner Charles S. Holmes. Prior to 1885, the PBMCo obtained all its logs by contract with independent operators, since Renton did not want to take on either the additional risk or capital investment of logging camps. The decreasing supply of accessible high-quality lumber and the steady inflation in log prices led him to change his policy. He noted in 1864 that timber \""contiguous to the Sound is nearly exhausted.\"" The company purchased land north of Olympia, and constructed the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor Railroad to transport the logs. By 1891, the company held 80,000 acres of timber land. A fire destroyed the mill in 1888, but a new one, larger and more efficient, was in operation within the year. Â¶ The PBMCo would face other stiff challenges in the 1890s, and would do so without the guidance of Renton, who died in 1891. A devastating depression swept the United States in 1893, forcing the company to operate in a hostile economic climate. It also faced increased competition from eastern mills moving into the Pacific Northwest. The St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company managed to rival PBMCo's position as the largest mill in the region during the 1890s. Weyerhaeuser entered the region in 1900, purchasing 900,000 acres of timberland. The PBMCo became increasingly ill-suited for competition with firms better located for participation in the rail and cargo trades. Â¶ In February 1903 Renton's heirs sold the company to two men from Michigan, David E. Skinner and John W. Eddy. The mill burned again in 1907, and the one built to replace it was much smaller. By 1912, the new mill operated only sporadically. Demands generated by the First World War temporarily returned the mill's economic viability; after the war, the demand crashed, and so did the mill's brief economic resurgence. Eddy and Skinner closed it in 1922 and divided the PBMCo's assets. The defunct mill was dismantled in 1924. Eddy bought out Skinner in that same year, and from that point forward the PBMCo relied upon its timber holdings and was exclusively an Eddy family concern. Â¶ "

Â¶ Topaz did not experience any of the violent upheavals that occurred at other camps, but the resentment of Topaz's residents did occasionally erupt into overt resistance. Probably the largest such episode occurred after a military policeman shot and killed James Wakasa near Topaz's barbed wire fence on April 11, 1943. Residents did not accept the policeman's claim that Wakasa was trying to escape. They demanded that the WRA include community leaders on a committee to investigate the incident. They also demanded that Wakasa's funeral take place at the spot where he was killed. When the WRA resisted these demands, almost all of Topaz refused to work. Even after the WRA allowed the outdoor funeral and the Army court martialed the policeman, residents were not mollified. The work stoppage continued until Wakasa's funeral. When Wakasa's killer was found not guilty at his court martial, this information was censored from the camp newspaper for fear of further protests. Â¶ While Wakasa's death brought the community together, other Army and WRA policies divided it. In February and March of 1943 the WRA administered a questionnaire that asked all residents if they were willing to defend the U.S. by serving in its military and if they would announce their allegiance to the U.S. and foreswear any loyalty to the Japanese government. Many Topaz residents found the questions to be poorly worded; they debated over how to interpret them and how to respond. Division soon erupted between those who answered the two key questions in the affirmative and those who gave negative responses. The WRA used the questionnaire to segregate the respondents. Those who answered both questions with no were moved to the Tule Lake Relocation Center. Those who gave positive answers stayed in Topaz and were allowed to find work in the Midwest or East Coast or to volunteer for the Army. Â¶ Given the widespread and often violent racism in both the military and in the civilian workforce, many residents were not anxious to risk what little savings they had and to leave their families in Topaz while they fought or looked for work. Only 2,500 or so of the 9,000 residents had left Topaz by early 1944. When the WRA pressured residents to move out and find work in late 1944, the community was wracked with tension as to whether it should cooperate or resist what the WRA called its \""resettlement efforts.\"" The point became moot when Japan surrendered. The government then allowed Japanese Americans to return to the West Coast. The WRA announced that Topaz would close on November 1, 1945. Roughly 60% of Topaz's residents eventually returned to the Bay Area.Â¶ "

Through its mission \""to protect, restore, and sustain Washington's environment for all,\"" the organization has served as a coordinating body on issues of statewide significance. Among other achievements, the WEC has worked to enforce and pass the State Environmental Policy Act, the State Superfund Law, the Growth Management Act, and the Shoreline Management Act. It also operates the Environmental Priorities Coalition and the Voter Education Program. Throughout its history, the organization has also focused on other issues related to carbon pollution, clean energy, water pollution, forests, and public lands.Â¶ In 1986 and 1987, the WEC was heavily involved with the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Implementation Project, which was the result of negotiations between the timber industry, the four natural resource agencies in Washington State, Indian tribes, and environmentalists. The Project is a cooperative plan for managing forest harvest practices on both state and private timberlands. Marcy Golde was involved with the negotiations, while Lisa Lombardy served as the WEC's statewide coordinator. Other WEC staff, through private funding, monitored timber harvest applications.Â¶ Another major legal case in which the WEC was involved concerned Washington State rules that imposed requirements on the design, equipment, reporting, and operations of oil tankers. Washington State, with the help of the WEC, defeated the trade association Intertanko, which represented operators of oil tanker ships. In 2000, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision on the basis that federal law pre-empts state rules. Â¶ "

1732-011,North Cascades Conservation Council,North Cascades Conservation Council records,"The North Cascades Conservation Council (NCCC) was organized in 1957 with the mission \""to protect and preserve the North Cascades' scenic, scientific, recreational, educational, and wilderness values.\"" For the next ten years, NCCC was dedicated to its main goal, the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. It was aided by other organizations dedicated to conservation, such as the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. Â¶ Conservation efforts targeting the North Cascades did not begin with NCCC. Concerns about the area were voiced as early as 1892, when a park proposal for Lake Chelan was presented but denounced as being against public interests. In 1937, the first formal proposal for a North Cascades National Park was submitted by the U.S. National Park Service and Owen A. Tomlinson. The proposal was impeded by opposition from the U.S. Forest Service, which had recently lost the battle over the formation of Olympic National Park. Â¶ In the mid-1950s, Grant McConnell, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focused on public land policy, raised the call for an organization to protect the North Cascades. Disturbed by the U.S. Forest Service's plans for timber sales, mining, and construction of a cross-mountain highway over Cascade Pass, McConnell convinced Polly Dyer to call a meeting at her home to discuss the threats to the North Cascades wilderness. McConnell's main objective was the formation of a single-issue conservation group dedicated to the North Cascades. Meeting attendees resisted McConnell's plan, citing the work being done on the issue by the Mountaineers Conservation Division, to which many attendees belonged. The Mountaineers Glacier Peak Subcommitee, chaired by Philip Zalesky, was also praised for its concentration on an important geographic area of the North Cascades. After the meeting, McConnell and other Sierra Club members worked to persuade North Cascades conservation leaders to form an organization. Patrick Goldsworthy was one of those leaders, and he later became the long-time president of NCCC. Â¶ Goldsworthy had proven himself to be a committed Northwest conservationist in the early 1950s. After moving to Seattle in 1952 to accept a research appointment in the University of Washington School of Medicine, he joined the Mountaineers Conservation Division and met John and Polly Dyer. Goldsworthy, together with his wife, Jane, and the Dyers, established the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club in 1954. Â¶ On March 23, 1957, during a Glacier Peak conference in Portland, Oregon, Goldsworthy and others took up the call to protect the North Cascades. Twenty-six people from Washington, Oregon, and California were present for the formation of the North Cascades Conservation Council. NCCC designated its immediate goal as the formation of the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area. Bylaws were written and officers were elected. Philip Zalesky served as president, Pat Goldsworthy as first vice-president, Una Davies as second vice-president, Polly Dyer as secretary, and Yvonne Prater as treasurer. Harvey Manning later joined the group as editor of the NCCC's newsletter. Â¶ With Patrick Goldsworthy serving as leader of both NCCC and the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club, assistance from the national Sierra Club and its executive director, David Brower, was quickly forthcoming. The Sierra Club had begun leading its first outing trips into the North Cascades a year earlier. In 1957, the Sierra Club produced the film, The Wilderness Alps of Stehekin. Publicizing the cause of the North Cascades, the film was shown extensively by the NCCC and other conservation groups. It was also circulated to public officials and members of Congress. Â¶ The Sierra Club furthered its commitment to the Pacific Northwest in 1961 by hiring Michael McCloskey, the first Northwest Conservation representative. The representative was funded by the Federation of the Western Outdoor Clubs and served as a valuable lobbyist and advocate for the formation of national parks and wilderness areas in the Northwest. Â¶ By 1959, support for a North Cascades National Park was strong among conservation organizations, including the NCCC, the National Parks Association, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Cascadians. Conservationists called for the U.S. Forest Service to suspend its plans for timber sales and road construction, and to allow the U.S. National Park Service to conduct a study of the possible park area. Washington Congressman Thomas Pelly, a vocal advocate of conservation, asked the U.S. National Park Service to conduct the study, only to be reprimanded by the director of the U.S. Forest Service for neglecting to ask for permission. Congressman Pelly, with the assistance of the Interior Department and groups such as the NCCC, then attempted to introduce legislation to order the study, but was unsuccessful. Â¶ In 1961, Pelly was presented with a petition bearing 22,000 signatures in favor of a park study. That same year, Washington Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson also joined the debate when they encouraged Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman to develop a forest management plan for the contested areas. Freeman imposed a temporary moratorium on logging, which ended the following year, only to be asked by Pelly to impose a stricter moratorium on logging until a national park study was held. Freeman denied the request, since the U.S. Forest Service had completed a high mountain management policy for the North Cascades. Â¶ In 1963, after disputes between the U.S. Park and Forest Services were settled, a joint study of the North Cascades was announced. The study was recommended by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, and the study team was chaired by the director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Edward C. Crafts. Public hearings to introduce the study were held in Seattle, Wenatchee, and Mount Vernon. The NCCC worked diligently to ensure a majority of oral and written statements in support of park establishment. The NCCC also submitted a comprehensive 120-page plan for the park, entitled Prospectus for a North Cascades National Park. The Prospectus confirmed the NCCC's leadership in the park campaign. Â¶ The study team's report, The North Cascades, was published in October 1965, recommending the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. The Sierra Club published the influential book, The Wild Cascades: Forgotten Parkland, in 1965 as well, to draw further attention to the area. Public hearings were held in 1966 to discuss the study team's findings. On March 20, 1967, Senators Jackson and Magnuson introduced Senate Bill 1321, which established the North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The bill was passed in November, and the following year, in October 1968, the North Cascades National Park Service Complex was created by an act of Congress. Â¶ Another long struggle to which the NCCC was committed was passing the Wilderness Act. The legislative effort began in 1956 as a wilderness bill drafted by Howard Zahniser, director of the Wilderness Society. The bill called for the conservation of the nation's remaining wilderness. Despite initial opposition and numerous revisions, the Wilderness Act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. The act created the National Wilderness Preservation System and put 9.1 million acres of national forest land into the new system. It was the first wilderness protection legislation passed in the world. Â¶ The first major crisis to occur under the Wilderness Act began in 1967 with Kennecott Copper Corporation's plan to create an open-pit mine in Miners Ridge, a location inside the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area and close to Image Lake. Since Kennecott owned the mineral rights to the land, the Wilderness Act's clause regarding private ownership seemed to protect the mine's development. Under pressure from tremendous publicity and opposition by the NCCC and Washington congressmen, Kennecott decided to postpone its plans, although talk of commencing mining operations resumed in 1969 when copper prices soared. The land was later bought from Kennecott and the area protected from commercial interests. Â¶ The NCCC also participated in the debate over roadways in national parks. The Park Service program launched Mission 66 in 1956 to improve deteriorating and dangerous conditions in the national parks that largely resulted from a massive boom in visitors after World War II. Mission 66 expanded visitor capacity in the national parks to accommodate an estimated eighty million automobile tourists within ten years. The program called for adding more overnight accommodations, building visitor centers, and constructing park roads. The roadway debate continued in 1957, when the Washington State legislature authorized a survey for a cross-Cascades highway. On September 2, 1972, the highway, known as the North Cascades Highway, officially opened, to the dismay of NCCC members. Another debate began in 1961 regarding the Outdoor Advertising Act, which established billboard control along scenic highways. The NCCC called for more aggressive controls and restrictions of outdoor advertising than the controversial act established in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the Northwest. Â¶ Over the past third of a century, the NCCC has accomplished much in conservation, including the creation of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Glacier Peak Wilderness, William O. Douglas Wilderness (Cougar Lakes Wilderness Area), Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Mt. Baker Wilderness, Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, and others. The NCCC has also collaborated with British Columbia allies to block the raising of Ross Dam and to encourage the establishment of a U.S.-Canadian international park. In addition, the NCCC newsletter, The Wild Cascades, has kept its members and other conservationists informed of and dedicated to the various issues affecting the North Cascades. The North Cascades Conservation Council has been a leader in the protection and preservation of the North Cascades mountain range from the Columbia River to the U.S.-Canadian border. Â¶ "

0035-002,"Reed, Mark E. (Mark Edward), 1866-1933",Mark E. Reed papers,"Lumberman, financier, politician, and Washington state representative. Â¶ Mark Reed, president of the Simpson Logging Company and speaker of the state House of Representatives, stood at the center of Washington politics throughout the 1920s. Many contemporary observers agreed that Reed could have been elected governor if he had so desired, but business came before politics for Reed: he repeatedly decided that his company would suffer too much if he had to devote most of his time to a governor's duties. Â¶ Born in Olympia in 1866, Reed did not find financial success until 1897 when Sol Simpson hired him to manage the Simpson Logging Company's store in the town of Shelton. After several promotions, he married the boss's daughter, Irene, in 1901. Reed took over the management of the company upon Sol Simpson death in 1906. Simpson Logging was already the biggest company in Shelton, and as Reed expanded the firm, Shelton grew with it. Reed strove to build a firm that could weather the storms of the notoriously turbulent timber industry. While he resisted the unionization of his labor force, he sought to reduce turnover by continually improving living conditions in his logging camps. Â¶ Reed also built two mills in Shelton which brought a degree of vertical integration and allowed the firm to make pulp and other products out of wood that had previously been wasted. These strategies, coupled with Reed's refusal to take on large amounts of debt, allowed Simpson Logging to grow during the 1920s and to survive the Great Depression. Reed also sought to promote cooperation among timber companies and to create stability in lumber markets. As a member of the Spruce Production Board during the First World War, Reed tried to persuade fellow lumbermen to adopt the eight-hour day to undercut the appeal of the Industrial Workers of the World. Reed was later influential in convincing Colonel Bryce Disque, head of the Army's Spruce Production Division, to compel recalcitrant firms to accept the eight-hour day. In the mid- to late-1920s Reed was a key player in the West Coast Lumbermen's Association's failed attempts to get logging companies to drive up prices by limiting their output. Reed directed the unsuccessful fight to raise the tariff on Canadian logs and lumber in 1929. He also participated in the negotiations of the National Recovery Administration's lumber code shortly before his death in 1933. Â¶ Reed brought the same pragmatism and bargaining skills to his political career. After serving as mayor of Shelton for four years, Reed won a seat in the state House of Representatives as a Republican in 1914. Although he strongly favored reducing taxes and opposed most Progressive era reforms, Reed was willing to compromise with reformers and organized labor. His ability to negotiate legislative deals led to his rapid promotion to positions of leadership. He was elected Speaker of the House every legislative session between 1923 and 1929. The biggest fight of Reed's career came when fellow Republican Roland Hartley was inaugurated governor in 1925. Hartley tried to increase the governor's control over administrative agencies and to slash spending on education, roads, and reclamation. When Reed killed the governor's bills, Washington Republicans split into Reed and Hartley factions. Although he narrowly mustered the votes necessary to pass several bills over Hartley's vetoes in 1925, Reed did not want to perpetuate the split in the party. In 1927 and 1929 Reed helped craft compromises between pro- and anti-Hartley forces, most of which enhanced Hartley's power. With his business hit by the Depression and with Hartley clearly replacing him as the dominant player in the Washington Republican Party, Reed decided not to seek re-election in 1930. He did not, however, drop out of politics altogether. Reed agreed to manage President Hoover's re-election campaign in Washington state in 1932, just as he had managed Calvin Coolidge's campaign in 1924 and Hoover's in 1928. Â¶ "

0001-001,Port Blakely Mill Company,Port Blakely Mill Company records,"Lumber mill.Â¶ At its height, the Port Blakely Mill Company was the largest on the Pacific Coast, and possibly in the entire world. Captain William Renton founded it in 1863 on Bainbridge Island, directly across from Seattle in the Puget Sound. Within a year the mill was turning out 50,000 board feet a day. The PBMCo expanded rapidly, as did the timber industry in Washington territory generally. (In the 1880s, the territory's annual timber production soared from 160 million board feet to over a billion). Although the California market was the most crucial, the PBMCo shipped its lumber throughout the Pacific Rim. The PBMCo briefly tried to enter the European market, but the long voyage around South America posed too great of a logistical challenge for consistent shipments to Europe. Â¶ In 1876, Renton incorporated the company in San Francisco with new partner Charles S. Holmes. Prior to 1885, the PBMCo obtained all its logs by contract with independent operators, since Renton did not want to take on either the additional risk or capital investment of logging camps. The decreasing supply of accessible high-quality lumber and the steady inflation in log prices led him to change his policy. He noted in 1864 that timber \""contiguous to the Sound is nearly exhausted.\"" The company purchased land north of Olympia, and constructed the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor Railroad to transport the logs. By 1891, the company held 80,000 acres of timber land. A fire destroyed the mill in 1888, but a new one, larger and more efficient, was in operation within the year. Â¶ The PBMCo would face other stiff challenges in the 1890s, and would do so without the guidance of Renton, who died in 1891. A devastating depression swept the United States in 1893, forcing the company to operate in a hostile economic climate. It also faced increased competition from eastern mills moving into the Pacific Northwest. The St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company managed to rival PBMCo's position as the largest mill in the region during the 1890s. Weyerhaeuser entered the region in 1900, purchasing 900,000 acres of timberland. The PBMCo became increasingly ill-suited for competition with firms better located for participation in the rail and cargo trades. Â¶ In February 1903 Renton's heirs sold the company to two men from Michigan, David E. Skinner and John W. Eddy. The mill burned again in 1907, and the one built to replace it was much smaller. By 1912, the new mill operated only sporadically. Demands generated by the First World War temporarily returned the mill's economic viability; after the war, the demand crashed, and so did the mill's brief economic resurgence. Eddy and Skinner closed it in 1922 and divided the PBMCo's assets. The defunct mill was dismantled in 1924. Eddy bought out Skinner in that same year, and from that point forward the PBMCo relied upon its timber holdings and was exclusively an Eddy family concern. Â¶ "

Marcy Golde was involved with the negotiations, while Lisa Lombardy served as the WEC's statewide coordinator.

Annual conventions, held primarily in California, Oregon, and Washington, have been held by FWOC since 1932, gathering delegates from member clubs to decide federation positions on conservation issues. Resolutions are submitted during and before each conference by members and club officials. The official resolutions are subsequently used to urge legislators, public officials, and private bodies to work for conservation goals. Annual reports are submitted by the federation's elected officials, and FWOC has also kept member clubs informed about new developments in the preservation of the West's natural resources through an annual periodical.

Â¶ The Paul brothers dominated the ANB from 1920 to 1940. William was elected Grand Secretary in 1920, the same year he passed the bar, making him the first Alaska native attorney. The ANB re-elected him Grand Secretary in 1921, 1922, 1935, 1938, and 1951. He won the office of Grand President in 1928, 1929, and 1955. Louis served as Grand Secretary twice and as Grand President three times between 1919 and 1939. The ANB, founded in 1912 by Tlingit Presbyterians associated with the Sitka Industrial Training School, originally saw its mission as civilizing the Indians of Southeast Alaska. In 1915 the ANB successfully lobbied the territorial legislature to pass a law giving citizenship and voting rights to natives who learned English and held jobs in the cash economy. The Pauls retained the ANB's focus on assimilating and Christianizing Indians. They argued, however, that Alaska natives were already US citizens by birth, and were therefore entitled to the rights and privileges associated with citizenship. The district court finally adopted this position in 1922, when William Paul successfully defended the right of his brother's father-in-law to vote in US vs. Charlie Jones. Â¶ William Paul made the ANB a major force in Alaskan politics. He spent much of the early 1920s organizing new ANB chapters throughout southeast Alaska, boosting membership from 100 in 1920 to 2,200 by 1935. He also started and edited a newspaper, Alaska Fisherman, published in Ketchikan from 1923 to 1932. The paper devoted much of its space to denouncing white cannery owners who monopolized native fishing grounds. William Paul used his newspaper and his ANB connections to great advantage in his successful 1924 and 1926 campaigns for the Alaska legislature, becoming the first native Alaskan to serve in that body. He passed a bill that made Alaska natives eligible to receive assistance under the territory's widows, orphans, and old age pension laws. Paul also fended off a challenge to native voting rights in the form of a literacy test. The law passed, but Paul amended it to exclude from its provisions all those who had previously voted. Without this amendment, the literacy test would have disenfranchised most of the native population. Charges that Paul accepted campaign contributions from canneries cost him his bid for re-election in 1928. He also lost his campaigns for territorial attorney general in 1930 and 1932. Nonetheless, Paul continued his successful private law practice. He tried many Indian rights cases, including one that forced the Ketchikan public schools to accept Indian children in 1929. Â¶ In the mid 1930s, William Paul worked for the ANB in Washington, DC. He authored a bill that allowed the Tlingit and Haida Indians to sue the government in a test case to determine the validity of their land claims; Congress passed this law in 1935. Paul was also instrumental in extending the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) to Alaska in 1936. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) then hired Paul to help villages draft IRA constitutions. Paul, however, suffered several setbacks in the late 1930s. In 1937 the Alaska Bar Association prohibited Paul from practicing law on the grounds that he had defrauded a client. The BIA fired Paul shortly thereafter. Â¶ The ANB was divided sharply over whether to allow William Paul a major role in planning the Tlingit-Haida land claims suit. Paul would not be readmitted to the Bar until January 1959. His disbarment reduced his influence in the ANB, which turned to the rival Peratrovich family for leadership. Nonetheless, the BIA required the Haida and Tlingit to form a joint council to decide how to prosecute the suit and how to distribute the benefits, and Paul was elected head of this council in 1941. The Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska (CCTHITA), founded in 1935, became one of the leading organizations campaigning for native Alaskan rights from the 1940s onwards. Paul's two sons, William Lackey Paul (often referred to as William L. Paul, Jr.) and Louis Frederick Paul (known as Fred Paul), were designated attorneys for the case against the government. The BIA and the Peratroviches removed the Pauls from the case in 1944, hiring instead the nationally known attorney James Curry. Â¶ William Paul dissented from Curry's contention that the Tlingit and Haida were distinct tribal groups whose land holdings had been usurped by whites. Paul argued that the â€˜Tlingit' and â€˜Haida', as represented by the CCTHIA, reflected linguistic rather than tribal groupings. He believed that class action for Native lands claims must be brought by individual tribes rather than the CCTHIA. Paul helped BIA Commissioner Dillon Meyer remove Curry from the case in 1953, forcing the Tlingit and Haida to hire attorney Israel Weissbrodt. Meanwhile, Paul and his sons, despite great opposition from the ANB, brought a series of cases designed to force the courts to accept Paul's theories about the Haida and Tlingit claims. The cases culminated with Tee-Hit-Ton vs. US (1955). The Supreme Court stated that compensation could not be awarded for Native Land Claims unless recognized specifically by Congress, and rejected Paul's theory about the Tlingit and Haida. The CCTHIA was later re-organized, however, in order to reflect more accurately tribal structures in Southeast Alaska. Although considered a setback for Native rights, the Tee-Hit-Ton case did not end the Tlingit-Haida Land Claims action. The Court of Claims ruled in 1959 that the Tlingit and Haida had occupied and owned the entire area of southeast Alaska at the time the state was purchased by the US in 1867. Compensation of $7.5 million was awarded to the CCTHIA in 1968. Organizations including the ANB and the Alaska Federation of Natives International would continue meanwhile to campaign for Native land claim settlements across Alaska. Â¶ Paul moved to Seattle following the Tee-Hit-Ton case, and became gradually less active within the ANB. He adopted the role of an advisor rather than a leader within the organization. He frequently sent open letters to the ANB membership that set out his goals for the organization and his opinions of its leaders' policies. Although he was not active in the passage of the landmark 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, his sons were and corresponded with him on the matter. The settlement awarded both land and compensation to Alaskan Natives, to be administered by twelve regional corporations within the state and one outside. Paul would remain involved with Native rights issues and organizations through the final years of his life. He practiced law as late as 1972, and paid active dues to the Alaska Bar Association until 1974. William Lewis Paul died in 1977. Â¶ "

The name became the Jewish Welfare Society in 1929 until 1947. From this time until 1978, it became the Jewish Family and Child Service. The name changes reflect the changing needs of the community JFS served and its broadening services. The Ladies Hebrew Benevolent Society was founded by Esther Levy, who with her daughter, organized the all volunteer group that was committed to offering hope and new direction.

The original members included librarians from Washington and Oregon, as well as the Provincial Librarian of British Columbia, but the membership grew to include librarians from Idaho, Montana and Utah. The PNLA affiliated with the American Library Association (ALA) in 1914. Among the achievements of the PNLA was the creation of the Subscription Books Bulletin in 1917, which eventually merged with another publication to become the ALA's Booklist.

Through its mission \""to protect, restore, and sustain Washington's environment for all,\"" the organization has served as a coordinating body on issues of statewide significance. Among other achievements, the WEC has worked to enforce and pass the State Environmental Policy Act, the State Superfund Law, the Growth Management Act, and the Shoreline Management Act. It also operates the Environmental Priorities Coalition and the Voter Education Program. Throughout its history, the organization has also focused on other issues related to carbon pollution, clean energy, water pollution, forests, and public lands.Â¶ In 1986 and 1987, the WEC was heavily involved with the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Implementation Project, which was the result of negotiations between the timber industry, the four natural resource agencies in Washington State, Indian tribes, and environmentalists. The Project is a cooperative plan for managing forest harvest practices on both state and private timberlands. Marcy Golde was involved with the negotiations, while Lisa Lombardy served as the WEC's statewide coordinator. Other WEC staff, through private funding, monitored timber harvest applications.Â¶ Another major legal case in which the WEC was involved concerned Washington State rules that imposed requirements on the design, equipment, reporting, and operations of oil tankers. Washington State, with the help of the WEC, defeated the trade association Intertanko, which represented operators of oil tanker ships. In 2000, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision on the basis that federal law pre-empts state rules. Â¶ "

The Henry Art Gallery is a nationally-recognized center for the exploration of visual culture and is the Pacific Northwest's premier modern and contemporary art museum. The museum's exhibitions bring important works of art to Seattle from throughout the world and bring into public view works of art from the Northwest. These exhibitions and their related programs invite dialogue about contemporary culture, politics, aesthetics and the traditions of visual art and design of the last two centuries. Exhibitions at the Henry frequently present recent or newly commissioned work of visually and conceptually challenging artists such as Ann Hamilton (1992), Gary Hill (1994), Kara Walker (1998), Roni Horn (1998), Leone & Macdonald (1999), Josiah McElheny (1998), Jennifer Steinkamp (1999), IÃ±igo Manglano-Ovalle (2000) and Tony Oursler (2000). The museum also hosts nationally and internationally touring exhibitions such as Deep Storage, The Arsenal of Memory (1998), Thinking Print (1998), Inside Out: New Chinese Art (1999-2000) and Andy Warhol: Drawings, 1942-1987 (July 20 - October 8, 2000). Â¶ The museum's major renovation and expansion, completed in April 1997, quadrupled the museum's size - from 10,000 square feet to over 40,000 square feet.

1732-005,North Cascades Conservation Council,North Cascades Conservation Council records,"The North Cascades Conservation Council (NCCC) was organized in 1957 with the mission \""to protect and preserve the North Cascades' scenic, scientific, recreational, educational, and wilderness values.\"" For the next ten years, NCCC was dedicated to its main goal, the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. It was aided by other organizations dedicated to conservation, such as the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. Â¶ Conservation efforts targeting the North Cascades did not begin with NCCC. Concerns about the area were voiced as early as 1892, when a park proposal for Lake Chelan was presented but denounced as being against public interests. In 1937, the first formal proposal for a North Cascades National Park was submitted by the U.S. National Park Service and Owen A. Tomlinson. The proposal was impeded by opposition from the U.S. Forest Service, which had recently lost the battle over the formation of Olympic National Park. Â¶ In the mid-1950s, Grant McConnell, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focused on public land policy, raised the call for an organization to protect the North Cascades. Disturbed by the U.S. Forest Service's plans for timber sales, mining, and construction of a cross-mountain highway over Cascade Pass, McConnell convinced Polly Dyer to call a meeting at her home to discuss the threats to the North Cascades wilderness. McConnell's main objective was the formation of a single-issue conservation group dedicated to the North Cascades. Meeting attendees resisted McConnell's plan, citing the work being done on the issue by the Mountaineers Conservation Division, to which many attendees belonged. The Mountaineers Glacier Peak Subcommitee, chaired by Philip Zalesky, was also praised for its concentration on an important geographic area of the North Cascades. After the meeting, McConnell and other Sierra Club members worked to persuade North Cascades conservation leaders to form an organization. Patrick Goldsworthy was one of those leaders, and he later became the long-time president of NCCC. Â¶ Goldsworthy had proven himself to be a committed Northwest conservationist in the early 1950s. After moving to Seattle in 1952 to accept a research appointment in the University of Washington School of Medicine, he joined the Mountaineers Conservation Division and met John and Polly Dyer. Goldsworthy, together with his wife, Jane, and the Dyers, established the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club in 1954. Â¶ On March 23, 1957, during a Glacier Peak conference in Portland, Oregon, Goldsworthy and others took up the call to protect the North Cascades. Twenty-six people from Washington, Oregon, and California were present for the formation of the North Cascades Conservation Council. NCCC designated its immediate goal as the formation of the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area. Bylaws were written and officers were elected. Philip Zalesky served as president, Pat Goldsworthy as first vice-president, Una Davies as second vice-president, Polly Dyer as secretary, and Yvonne Prater as treasurer. Harvey Manning later joined the group as editor of the NCCC's newsletter. Â¶ With Patrick Goldsworthy serving as leader of both NCCC and the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club, assistance from the national Sierra Club and its executive director, David Brower, was quickly forthcoming. The Sierra Club had begun leading its first outing trips into the North Cascades a year earlier. In 1957, the Sierra Club produced the film, The Wilderness Alps of Stehekin. Publicizing the cause of the North Cascades, the film was shown extensively by the NCCC and other conservation groups. It was also circulated to public officials and members of Congress. Â¶ The Sierra Club furthered its commitment to the Pacific Northwest in 1961 by hiring Michael McCloskey, the first Northwest Conservation representative. The representative was funded by the Federation of the Western Outdoor Clubs and served as a valuable lobbyist and advocate for the formation of national parks and wilderness areas in the Northwest. Â¶ By 1959, support for a North Cascades National Park was strong among conservation organizations, including the NCCC, the National Parks Association, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Cascadians. Conservationists called for the U.S. Forest Service to suspend its plans for timber sales and road construction, and to allow the U.S. National Park Service to conduct a study of the possible park area. Washington Congressman Thomas Pelly, a vocal advocate of conservation, asked the U.S. National Park Service to conduct the study, only to be reprimanded by the director of the U.S. Forest Service for neglecting to ask for permission. Congressman Pelly, with the assistance of the Interior Department and groups such as the NCCC, then attempted to introduce legislation to order the study, but was unsuccessful. Â¶ In 1961, Pelly was presented with a petition bearing 22,000 signatures in favor of a park study. That same year, Washington Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson also joined the debate when they encouraged Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman to develop a forest management plan for the contested areas. Freeman imposed a temporary moratorium on logging, which ended the following year, only to be asked by Pelly to impose a stricter moratorium on logging until a national park study was held. Freeman denied the request, since the U.S. Forest Service had completed a high mountain management policy for the North Cascades. Â¶ In 1963, after disputes between the U.S. Park and Forest Services were settled, a joint study of the North Cascades was announced. The study was recommended by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, and the study team was chaired by the director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Edward C. Crafts. Public hearings to introduce the study were held in Seattle, Wenatchee, and Mount Vernon. The NCCC worked diligently to ensure a majority of oral and written statements in support of park establishment. The NCCC also submitted a comprehensive 120-page plan for the park, entitled Prospectus for a North Cascades National Park. The Prospectus confirmed the NCCC's leadership in the park campaign. Â¶ The study team's report, The North Cascades, was published in October 1965, recommending the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. The Sierra Club published the influential book, The Wild Cascades: Forgotten Parkland, in 1965 as well, to draw further attention to the area. Public hearings were held in 1966 to discuss the study team's findings. On March 20, 1967, Senators Jackson and Magnuson introduced Senate Bill 1321, which established the North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The bill was passed in November, and the following year, in October 1968, the North Cascades National Park Service Complex was created by an act of Congress. Â¶ Another long struggle to which the NCCC was committed was passing the Wilderness Act. The legislative effort began in 1956 as a wilderness bill drafted by Howard Zahniser, director of the Wilderness Society. The bill called for the conservation of the nation's remaining wilderness. Despite initial opposition and numerous revisions, the Wilderness Act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. The act created the National Wilderness Preservation System and put 9.1 million acres of national forest land into the new system. It was the first wilderness protection legislation passed in the world. Â¶ The first major crisis to occur under the Wilderness Act began in 1967 with Kennecott Copper Corporation's plan to create an open-pit mine in Miners Ridge, a location inside the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area and close to Image Lake. Since Kennecott owned the mineral rights to the land, the Wilderness Act's clause regarding private ownership seemed to protect the mine's development. Under pressure from tremendous publicity and opposition by the NCCC and Washington congressmen, Kennecott decided to postpone its plans, although talk of commencing mining operations resumed in 1969 when copper prices soared. The land was later bought from Kennecott and the area protected from commercial interests. Â¶ The NCCC also participated in the debate over roadways in national parks. The Park Service program launched Mission 66 in 1956 to improve deteriorating and dangerous conditions in the national parks that largely resulted from a massive boom in visitors after World War II. Mission 66 expanded visitor capacity in the national parks to accommodate an estimated eighty million automobile tourists within ten years. The program called for adding more overnight accommodations, building visitor centers, and constructing park roads. The roadway debate continued in 1957, when the Washington State legislature authorized a survey for a cross-Cascades highway. On September 2, 1972, the highway, known as the North Cascades Highway, officially opened, to the dismay of NCCC members. Another debate began in 1961 regarding the Outdoor Advertising Act, which established billboard control along scenic highways. The NCCC called for more aggressive controls and restrictions of outdoor advertising than the controversial act established in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the Northwest. Â¶ Over the past third of a century, the NCCC has accomplished much in conservation, including the creation of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Glacier Peak Wilderness, William O. Douglas Wilderness (Cougar Lakes Wilderness Area), Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Mt. Baker Wilderness, Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, and others. The NCCC has also collaborated with British Columbia allies to block the raising of Ross Dam and to encourage the establishment of a U.S.-Canadian international park. In addition, the NCCC newsletter, The Wild Cascades, has kept its members and other conservationists informed of and dedicated to the various issues affecting the North Cascades. The North Cascades Conservation Council has been a leader in the protection and preservation of the North Cascades mountain range from the Columbia River to the U.S.-Canadian border. Â¶ "

0036-002,"Bagley, Clarence, 1843-1932",Clarence Bagley papers,"From his arrival in Seattle in 1860 until his death in 1932 at the age of eighty-eight, Clarence Bagley was concerned with the growth of Washington as a Territory and State in general, and Seattle's growth as a city in particular. Soon after their arrival and his father's appointment as University Commissioner, Bagley became a clerk in the Surveyor General's office in 1866, shortly after his marriage to Alice Mercer. Â¶ This move brought him directly into politics and into the printing trade as well. While working in the Surveyor General's office in Olympia, Bagley came under the tutelage of Randall Hewitt, owner of the Territorial Republican and the Temperance Echo. With L. G. Abbott he bought the Echo in 1868 but sold his interest shortly thereafter and took employment with the Commercial Age, organ of the Republican Party. When this newspaper was discontinued in 1870, he returned to Seattle, remaining until May 1871, when he became deputy in the internal revenue office, holding the position until 1873. While in this office he worked with the Puget Sound Courier, finally buying it in 1873, and emerging as Territorial Printer for the next ten years. He sold the Courier and the printing office in 1884, returning to Seattle to stay in 1885 after a brief interval in Portland as a deputy collector of internal revenue. Â¶ By now a confirmed publisher, Clarence Bagley joined with others and purchased the Post-Intelligencer in 1886, which he managed until L. S. J. Hunt took it over that same year. Other ephemeral ventures followed, one in banking and one again in newspapers, joining with Homer Hill for two years in publishing the Daily Press. Â¶ In 1890 he was elected to the House of Delegates of the City Council from where he fought open gambling and Seattle's \""open town\"" policy with the result that doors were barred on many of the \""gambling hells. \"" Following upon this experience in elective office he acted as an adviser in writing the 1893 city charter, contributing clauses affecting assessments for local improvements. Â¶ From 1893 until his appointment as Secretary of the Board of Public Works in 1900, he worked in the City Comptroller's office. He continued as Secretary of the Board until his retirement in 1929. These experiences in city government and his ever-present concern for governmental efficiency led him to become candidate in 1909 for the Republican nomination for councilman from the Eighth Ward. He announced his candidacy in letters to friends, but did not actively canvass his ward for votes. He stressed his alarm with what, in his opinion, was a growing trend toward mismanagement and extravagance in city affairs. Promising a \""square deal, \"" Bagley felt this could be changed with a business-like economy and management terminating in better, cleaner government. Â¶ The election itself, with its many side issues, was unsettling for him as he associated political reporting with what he considered to be honestly partisan, and took exception to the methods used by 1910 newspapermen, not only in his own case but on behalf of all the candidates. He lost the election to Elbert F. Blaine, and explained that the loss was due to his association with the \""City Hall Gang, \"" whom the voters had rejected completely. Â¶ Until this point in his career, he appears to have been a public servant first and a historian second. Now his interest in historical writing resurfaced. He had begun two years previously to edit the manuscripts of William I. Marshall's Acquisition of Oregon. Marshall, whom Bagley had met in 1905, had devoted twenty years to disproving the \""Whitman Saved Oregon\"" myth, and after his death in 1906, Bagley and Thompson Coit Elliott, both interested in seeing the work published, joined to edit the manuscript and to assist the widow financially. Â¶ Despite feeling that his position with the Board of Public Works took too much time away from historical study, he stayed on as Secretary, editing Marshall's work for publication in his spare time; it appeared in 1911. This was followed by publication of articles in historical quarterlies and journals, and in 1916, The History of Seattle appeared, culminating more than two years of research. Â¶ With publication of this work, Clarence Bagley's often-expressed dream of writing the history of his region was becoming a reality. He had little sympathy for writers who romanticized the facts of history into fiction that bore little or no resemblance to actuality. However, his view of \""actuality\"" was restricted by rigid adherence to the \""pioneer code\"" on the one hand and self-imposed limitations on the other, as he illustrated in a letter to Edmond S. Meany in 1911: Â¶ \""Sometime I shall write a history of Seattle, and while what I shall say will be the truth I shall not give all the truth. I shall rake up no old stories of evil. \"" Â¶ His activities were not confined to writing. He gave his time freely in efforts to organize pioneer societies and similar groups, frequently being called upon for speeches and public appearances in connection with pioneer-inspired celebrations. Â¶ In 1905 he had become deeply involved in a dispute between the historical societies of Seattle and Tacoma. Consolidation of effort and location under the aegis of the State was suggested by the Seattle group when its members (including Meany, Cornelius Hanford, Thomas Burke, Roger S. Greene and John P. Hoyt) decided that the Tacoma society was \""dead. \"" Most of the members of the Seattle group had aided in founding the Washington State Historical Society in 1891. But the early years turned into a struggle for mere existence which Bagley et al regarded as a hindrance to accomplishment of the Society's original purposes of collection and preservation of historical source materials. This suggestion revitalized the slumbering rivalry of the two cities and the battle was joined. Bagley became the unofficial spokesman for the Washington University State Historical Society which had been newly founded. In a letter to Professor J.N. Bowman of the State Normal School in Bellingham, he explained: Â¶ \""Experience had proved that the Societies thus allied with State Universities have done the best work, and that this will be true here.\"" Â¶ Proposals of merger were not accepted by Tacoma, and the Washington State Historical Society remained a separate body. Unallied with the Tacoma group in either effort or ideals, Bagley was elected president of the Washington University State Historical Society, and under his leadership the work of collecting and preserving original data was begun. His vision of a central repository for historical research materials was challenged once again in 1915, when the King County Historical Society sought allocation of land on University-owned property. Â¶ In a letter to Winlock W. Miller of Seattle, Bagley called for a \""concert of action in historical efforts, \"" insisting that \""I have seen so many similar efforts live a precarious existence and finally die from slow decay that I may be permitted to express doubts as to the long life or active work of the present one.\"" Â¶ In the public mind Bagley symbolized Pacific Northwest history in many ways. The post-office delivered letters to him addressed merely \""Historian, Seattle, Washington;\"" newspapers of the city began to refer to him affectionately as \""Pop, \"" and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce directed all of its inquiries on historical matters to his desk in City Hall. Â¶ In 1929 he brought out his History of King County. With retirement, articles and pamphlets began to appear with regularity. Indian Myths of the Northwest, \""compiled, annotated and expurgated\"" as he wrote to a friend, was published in 1930. Â¶ Plans for future publications simmered. Clarence Bagley began 1932 with letters to friends expressing enthusiasm for his many historical projects, and often a small boast regarding his health.

1886-009,Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs,Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs records,"Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs (FWOC): \""As the American frontier closed in the late 19th century and a land ethic emerged founded on enjoyment and preservation of natural beauty rather than economic exploitation, people throughout the West began to gather in local outdoor clubs. In 1932, in reponse to the growing need for the cooperation and coordination of these clubs, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs (FWOC) was organized\"" (from FWOC pamphlet). Â¶ This coalition of hiking and outdoor recreation groups works to promote environmental conservation in the eight western states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, as well as Alaska and Western Canada. Annual conventions, held primarily in California, Oregon, and Washington, have been held by FWOC since 1932, gathering delegates from member clubs to decide federation positions on conservation issues. Resolutions are submitted during and before each conference by members and club officials. The official resolutions are subsequently used to urge legislators, public officials, and private bodies to work for conservation goals. Annual reports are submitted by the federation's elected officials, and FWOC has also kept member clubs informed about new developments in the preservation of the West's natural resources through an annual periodical. Published as Western Outdoor Quarterly from 1933 to 1969, and then as Western Outdoors Annual from 1970 to 1975, Outdoors West continues as FWOC's official publication. Â¶ FWOC's mission is to create a strong regional alliance of organizations dedicated to environmental protection. Working together, member clubs helped secure passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. They made important contributions to the establishment of the North Cascades National Park and the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in Washington State, as well as to the establishment of various wilderness areas in the national forests of Oregon and California. FWOC also helped to ensure the establishment of a national monument in the Sierra Nevada range to protect the remaining Giant Sequoia trees. Â¶ For some twenty years, FWOC shared a Northwest conservation representative with the Sierra Club to ensure further representation of the area's conservation goals. Michael McCloskey was first to hold the position (1961-1964), followed by Rodger Pegues (1964-1967). Brock Evans held the position from 1967 until 1973, when he became the Washington, D.C. representative. Roger Mellem was the acting Northwest conservation representative for 1973. Doug Scott continued the position until 1978, followed by the last representative, Jim Blomquist (1978-1980). The representative's main duty was to lobby for Northwest conservation through testimony at related hearings and through extensive correspondence with interested parties. Â¶ "

1940-006,AFL-CIO. King County Labor Council of Washington,"Martin Luther King, Jr. County Labor Council records","The King County Labor Council has long been the communal decision-making body of the various union locals in King County. From the mid-1920s until the reunification of the AFL and CIO in 1955, only AFL-affiliated unions were represented on the Council. At other times, however, the vast majority of King County's locals had a voice on the Council.

The Council has passed through at least four distinct periods in its history. The Council originally began in 1888 as the Western Central Labor Union. This body changed its name to the Central Labor Council of Seattle and Vicinity in 1905. These groups occasionally joined coalitions with Populists and other reform groups in local and state politics. Nonetheless, much of the early Council's energy was spent simply trying to survive. The second phase of the Council's history began roughly in 1914 with the labor shortage that allowed unions to organize much of Seattle. The Council grew increasingly radical in this period and became the dominant force in Seattle's powerful progressive coalition. The loss of the Council's power began with the mass layoffs of shipyard workers after World War I. These layoffs led the Council to call the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the only truly city-wide general strike in American history. Employers responded to the failed strike with an open shop drive that de-unionized most of King County. A series of internal power struggles plagued the Council after the strike. The Council voted to expel members of the Industrial Workers of the World in late 1919 and Communist Party members in 1925.

The growing conservative influence in the Council was solidified when Dave Beck and his Teamsters came to dominate the group in the late 1920s. The third phase of the Council's history was thus business unionism, Beck-style. Dave Beck began his career as a driver for the Council's cooperative laundry but rapidly rose to become the chief Teamster organizer west of the Rockies. Beck used the strategic position of truck drivers in the economy to start rebuilding the strength of organized labor in Seattle. If the Council declared a firm to be \""unfair to labor,\"" he could often prevent the firm from trucking its goods to market. Despite Beck's occasionally ruthless tactics, he believed that businesses had a right to make a profit. When the Great Depression spurred widespread organizing drives, many firms concluded that they would much rather deal with the avowedly anti-radical Beck than with a CIO union. The Council routinely backed Beck in his jurisdictional disputes with CIO and independent unions. Thus, by the end of World War II, Seattle was largely a closed-shop AFL town. Under Beck's reign, the Council stayed fairly aloof from politics, endorsing moderate pro-labor Democrats and spurning the leftist coalitions that fought for local and state offices.

The fourth stage of the Council's history, its reentry into local politics, began with the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955. The expanded Council was quickly put on the defensive by statewide right-to-work proposals in Initiative 198 in 1956 and Initiative 202 in 1958. The Council played a leading role in the campaigns that defeated these measures. After these victories, the Council went on the offensive. It started a pro-labor public relations campaign in 1959 that included donating money to charities and promoting radio and television appearances by labor leaders. Beginning in 1964, the Council's Committee on Political Education launched major voter registration drives before elections. The growth of public sector unions in the 1950s and 1960s, coupled with the addition of progressive CIO unions, led the Council to endorse expanded social services and public housing in this period. The Council also supported the efforts of Seattle civil rights groups during the 1960s. Nonetheless, the Council retained some traces of business unionism. It gave a no-strike pledge during the 1962 World's Fair and often helped the Chamber of Commerce lobby for subsidies for local businesses.

During the latter years of the 20th century, the period documented in Accession 1940-2, the council's executive secretaries were, in succession: James K. Bender, Dan Bickford, Ron Judd, and Steve Williamson.

In 2005, the name changed to Martin Luther King County Labor Council, commonly referred to as MLK Labor.

After initially taking Rimer's last name, Parkhurst returned to her maiden name, which she used for the rest of her life.Â¶ Parkhurst's political activism began in Boise, where she ran for city commissioner on the IWW-Socialist platform. She lost this campaign, and by 1914 she and Rimer had moved to Seattle, where she joined a theatre group and worked for the Neo-Malthusian League, which focused on birth control and population growth. She also served as the secretary of the Seattle Birth Control League and was a founding member of the Seattle branch of the International Workers' Defense League.Â¶ Through her activism, Parkhurst befriended and corresponded with many other political activists, including Emma Goldman and Louise Olivereau, who was imprisoned for sedition between 1917 and 1920. In August 1917, Olivereau had used her own money to distribute letters that urged men to refuse the draft, which was considered a crime under the Espionage Act. Parkhurst worked to appeal Olivereau's prison sentence and published a pamphlet about her friend's story that included excerpts from the trial transcript and the closing speech. Although she had been sentenced to ten years in prison, Olivereau ultimately served only twenty-eight months before her release in March 1920.Â¶ In addition to her activist work, Parkhurst enjoyed poetry, drama, hiking, and swimming.

1940-001,AFL-CIO. King County Labor Council of Washington,King County Labor Council records,"The King County Labor Council has long been the communal decision-making body of the various union locals in King County. From the mid-1920s until the reunification of the AFL and CIO in 1955, only AFL-affiliated unions were represented on the Council. At other times, however, the vast majority of King County's locals had a voice on the Council.

The Council has passed through at least four distinct periods in its history. The Council originally began in 1888 as the Western Central Labor Union. This body changed its name to the Central Labor Council of Seattle and Vicinity in 1905. These groups occasionally joined coalitions with Populists and other reform groups in local and state politics. Nonetheless, much of the early Council's energy was spent simply trying to survive. The second phase of the Council's history began roughly in 1914 with the labor shortage that allowed unions to organize much of Seattle. The Council grew increasingly radical in this period and became the dominant force in Seattle's powerful progressive coalition. The loss of the Council's power began with the mass layoffs of shipyard workers after World War I. These layoffs led the Council to call the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the only truly city-wide general strike in American history. Employers responded to the failed strike with an open shop drive that de-unionized most of King County. A series of internal power struggles plagued the Council after the strike. The Council voted to expel members of the Industrial Workers of the World in late 1919 and Communist Party members in 1925.

The growing conservative influence in the Council was solidified when Dave Beck and his Teamsters came to dominate the group in the late 1920s. The third phase of the Council's history was thus business unionism, Beck-style. Dave Beck began his career as a driver for the Council's cooperative laundry but rapidly rose to become the chief Teamster organizer west of the Rockies. Beck used the strategic position of truck drivers in the economy to start rebuilding the strength of organized labor in Seattle. If the Council declared a firm to be \""unfair to labor,\"" he could often prevent the firm from trucking its goods to market. Despite Beck's occasionally ruthless tactics, he believed that businesses had a right to make a profit. When the Great Depression spurred widespread organizing drives, many firms concluded that they would much rather deal with the avowedly anti-radical Beck than with a CIO union. The Council routinely backed Beck in his jurisdictional disputes with CIO and independent unions. Thus, by the end of World War II, Seattle was largely a closed-shop AFL town. Under Beck's reign, the Council stayed fairly aloof from politics, endorsing moderate pro-labor Democrats and spurning the leftist coalitions that fought for local and state offices.

The fourth stage of the Council's history, its reentry into local politics, began with the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955. The expanded Council was quickly put on the defensive by statewide right-to-work proposals in Initiative 198 in 1956 and Initiative 202 in 1958. The Council played a leading role in the campaigns that defeated these measures. After these victories, the Council went on the offensive. It started a pro-labor public relations campaign in 1959 that included donating money to charities and promoting radio and television appearances by labor leaders. Beginning in 1964, the Council's Committee on Political Education launched major voter registration drives before elections. The growth of public sector unions in the 1950s and 1960s, coupled with the addition of progressive CIO unions, led the Council to endorse expanded social services and public housing in this period. The Council also supported the efforts of Seattle civil rights groups during the 1960s. Nonetheless, the Council retained some traces of business unionism. It gave a no-strike pledge during the 1962 World's Fair and often helped the Chamber of Commerce lobby for subsidies for local businesses.

During the latter years of the 20th century, the period documented in Accession 1940-2, the council's executive secretaries were, in succession: James K. Bender, Dan Bickford, Ron Judd, and Steve Williamson.

In 2005, the name changed to Martin Luther King County Labor Council, commonly referred to as MLK Labor.

0001-008,Port Blakely Mill Company,Port Blakely Mill Company records,"Lumber mill.Â¶ At its height, the Port Blakely Mill Company was the largest on the Pacific Coast, and possibly in the entire world. Captain William Renton founded it in 1863 on Bainbridge Island, directly across from Seattle in the Puget Sound. Within a year the mill was turning out 50,000 board feet a day. The PBMCo expanded rapidly, as did the timber industry in Washington territory generally. (In the 1880s, the territory's annual timber production soared from 160 million board feet to over a billion). Although the California market was the most crucial, the PBMCo shipped its lumber throughout the Pacific Rim. The PBMCo briefly tried to enter the European market, but the long voyage around South America posed too great of a logistical challenge for consistent shipments to Europe. Â¶ In 1876, Renton incorporated the company in San Francisco with new partner Charles S. Holmes. Prior to 1885, the PBMCo obtained all its logs by contract with independent operators, since Renton did not want to take on either the additional risk or capital investment of logging camps. The decreasing supply of accessible high-quality lumber and the steady inflation in log prices led him to change his policy. He noted in 1864 that timber \""contiguous to the Sound is nearly exhausted.\"" The company purchased land north of Olympia, and constructed the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor Railroad to transport the logs. By 1891, the company held 80,000 acres of timber land. A fire destroyed the mill in 1888, but a new one, larger and more efficient, was in operation within the year. Â¶ The PBMCo would face other stiff challenges in the 1890s, and would do so without the guidance of Renton, who died in 1891. A devastating depression swept the United States in 1893, forcing the company to operate in a hostile economic climate. It also faced increased competition from eastern mills moving into the Pacific Northwest. The St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company managed to rival PBMCo's position as the largest mill in the region during the 1890s. Weyerhaeuser entered the region in 1900, purchasing 900,000 acres of timberland. The PBMCo became increasingly ill-suited for competition with firms better located for participation in the rail and cargo trades. Â¶ In February 1903 Renton's heirs sold the company to two men from Michigan, David E. Skinner and John W. Eddy. The mill burned again in 1907, and the one built to replace it was much smaller. By 1912, the new mill operated only sporadically. Demands generated by the First World War temporarily returned the mill's economic viability; after the war, the demand crashed, and so did the mill's brief economic resurgence. Eddy and Skinner closed it in 1922 and divided the PBMCo's assets. The defunct mill was dismantled in 1924. Eddy bought out Skinner in that same year, and from that point forward the PBMCo relied upon its timber holdings and was exclusively an Eddy family concern. Â¶ "

Among other achievements, the WEC has worked to enforce and pass the State Environmental Policy Act, the State Superfund Law, the Growth Management Act, and the Shoreline Management Act. It also operates the Environmental Priorities Coalition and the Voter Education Program. Throughout its history, the organization has also focused on other issues related to carbon pollution, clean energy, water pollution, forests, and public lands.Â¶ In 1986 and 1987, the WEC was heavily involved with the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Implementation Project, which was the result of negotiations between the timber industry, the four natural resource agencies in Washington State, Indian tribes, and environmentalists. The Project is a cooperative plan for managing forest harvest practices on both state and private timberlands. Marcy Golde was involved with the negotiations, while Lisa Lombardy served as the WEC's statewide coordinator. Other WEC staff, through private funding, monitored timber harvest applications.Â¶ Another major legal case in which the WEC was involved concerned Washington State rules that imposed requirements on the design, equipment, reporting, and operations of oil tankers. Washington State, with the help of the WEC, defeated the trade association Intertanko, which represented operators of oil tanker ships. In 2000, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision on the basis that federal law pre-empts state rules. Â¶ "

1732-013,North Cascades Conservation Council,North Cascades Conservation Council records,"The North Cascades Conservation Council (NCCC) was organized in 1957 with the mission \""to protect and preserve the North Cascades' scenic, scientific, recreational, educational, and wilderness values.\"" For the next ten years, NCCC was dedicated to its main goal, the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. It was aided by other organizations dedicated to conservation, such as the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. Â¶ Conservation efforts targeting the North Cascades did not begin with NCCC. Concerns about the area were voiced as early as 1892, when a park proposal for Lake Chelan was presented but denounced as being against public interests. In 1937, the first formal proposal for a North Cascades National Park was submitted by the U.S. National Park Service and Owen A. Tomlinson. The proposal was impeded by opposition from the U.S. Forest Service, which had recently lost the battle over the formation of Olympic National Park. Â¶ In the mid-1950s, Grant McConnell, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focused on public land policy, raised the call for an organization to protect the North Cascades. Disturbed by the U.S. Forest Service's plans for timber sales, mining, and construction of a cross-mountain highway over Cascade Pass, McConnell convinced Polly Dyer to call a meeting at her home to discuss the threats to the North Cascades wilderness. McConnell's main objective was the formation of a single-issue conservation group dedicated to the North Cascades. Meeting attendees resisted McConnell's plan, citing the work being done on the issue by the Mountaineers Conservation Division, to which many attendees belonged. The Mountaineers Glacier Peak Subcommitee, chaired by Philip Zalesky, was also praised for its concentration on an important geographic area of the North Cascades. After the meeting, McConnell and other Sierra Club members worked to persuade North Cascades conservation leaders to form an organization. Patrick Goldsworthy was one of those leaders, and he later became the long-time president of NCCC. Â¶ Goldsworthy had proven himself to be a committed Northwest conservationist in the early 1950s. After moving to Seattle in 1952 to accept a research appointment in the University of Washington School of Medicine, he joined the Mountaineers Conservation Division and met John and Polly Dyer. Goldsworthy, together with his wife, Jane, and the Dyers, established the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club in 1954. Â¶ On March 23, 1957, during a Glacier Peak conference in Portland, Oregon, Goldsworthy and others took up the call to protect the North Cascades. Twenty-six people from Washington, Oregon, and California were present for the formation of the North Cascades Conservation Council. NCCC designated its immediate goal as the formation of the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area. Bylaws were written and officers were elected. Philip Zalesky served as president, Pat Goldsworthy as first vice-president, Una Davies as second vice-president, Polly Dyer as secretary, and Yvonne Prater as treasurer. Harvey Manning later joined the group as editor of the NCCC's newsletter. Â¶ With Patrick Goldsworthy serving as leader of both NCCC and the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club, assistance from the national Sierra Club and its executive director, David Brower, was quickly forthcoming. The Sierra Club had begun leading its first outing trips into the North Cascades a year earlier. In 1957, the Sierra Club produced the film, The Wilderness Alps of Stehekin. Publicizing the cause of the North Cascades, the film was shown extensively by the NCCC and other conservation groups. It was also circulated to public officials and members of Congress. Â¶ The Sierra Club furthered its commitment to the Pacific Northwest in 1961 by hiring Michael McCloskey, the first Northwest Conservation representative. The representative was funded by the Federation of the Western Outdoor Clubs and served as a valuable lobbyist and advocate for the formation of national parks and wilderness areas in the Northwest. Â¶ By 1959, support for a North Cascades National Park was strong among conservation organizations, including the NCCC, the National Parks Association, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Cascadians. Conservationists called for the U.S. Forest Service to suspend its plans for timber sales and road construction, and to allow the U.S. National Park Service to conduct a study of the possible park area. Washington Congressman Thomas Pelly, a vocal advocate of conservation, asked the U.S. National Park Service to conduct the study, only to be reprimanded by the director of the U.S. Forest Service for neglecting to ask for permission. Congressman Pelly, with the assistance of the Interior Department and groups such as the NCCC, then attempted to introduce legislation to order the study, but was unsuccessful. Â¶ In 1961, Pelly was presented with a petition bearing 22,000 signatures in favor of a park study. That same year, Washington Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson also joined the debate when they encouraged Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman to develop a forest management plan for the contested areas. Freeman imposed a temporary moratorium on logging, which ended the following year, only to be asked by Pelly to impose a stricter moratorium on logging until a national park study was held. Freeman denied the request, since the U.S. Forest Service had completed a high mountain management policy for the North Cascades. Â¶ In 1963, after disputes between the U.S. Park and Forest Services were settled, a joint study of the North Cascades was announced. The study was recommended by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, and the study team was chaired by the director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Edward C. Crafts. Public hearings to introduce the study were held in Seattle, Wenatchee, and Mount Vernon. The NCCC worked diligently to ensure a majority of oral and written statements in support of park establishment. The NCCC also submitted a comprehensive 120-page plan for the park, entitled Prospectus for a North Cascades National Park. The Prospectus confirmed the NCCC's leadership in the park campaign. Â¶ The study team's report, The North Cascades, was published in October 1965, recommending the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. The Sierra Club published the influential book, The Wild Cascades: Forgotten Parkland, in 1965 as well, to draw further attention to the area. Public hearings were held in 1966 to discuss the study team's findings. On March 20, 1967, Senators Jackson and Magnuson introduced Senate Bill 1321, which established the North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The bill was passed in November, and the following year, in October 1968, the North Cascades National Park Service Complex was created by an act of Congress. Â¶ Another long struggle to which the NCCC was committed was passing the Wilderness Act. The legislative effort began in 1956 as a wilderness bill drafted by Howard Zahniser, director of the Wilderness Society. The bill called for the conservation of the nation's remaining wilderness. Despite initial opposition and numerous revisions, the Wilderness Act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. The act created the National Wilderness Preservation System and put 9.1 million acres of national forest land into the new system. It was the first wilderness protection legislation passed in the world. Â¶ The first major crisis to occur under the Wilderness Act began in 1967 with Kennecott Copper Corporation's plan to create an open-pit mine in Miners Ridge, a location inside the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area and close to Image Lake. Since Kennecott owned the mineral rights to the land, the Wilderness Act's clause regarding private ownership seemed to protect the mine's development. Under pressure from tremendous publicity and opposition by the NCCC and Washington congressmen, Kennecott decided to postpone its plans, although talk of commencing mining operations resumed in 1969 when copper prices soared. The land was later bought from Kennecott and the area protected from commercial interests. Â¶ The NCCC also participated in the debate over roadways in national parks. The Park Service program launched Mission 66 in 1956 to improve deteriorating and dangerous conditions in the national parks that largely resulted from a massive boom in visitors after World War II. Mission 66 expanded visitor capacity in the national parks to accommodate an estimated eighty million automobile tourists within ten years. The program called for adding more overnight accommodations, building visitor centers, and constructing park roads. The roadway debate continued in 1957, when the Washington State legislature authorized a survey for a cross-Cascades highway. On September 2, 1972, the highway, known as the North Cascades Highway, officially opened, to the dismay of NCCC members. Another debate began in 1961 regarding the Outdoor Advertising Act, which established billboard control along scenic highways. The NCCC called for more aggressive controls and restrictions of outdoor advertising than the controversial act established in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the Northwest. Â¶ Over the past third of a century, the NCCC has accomplished much in conservation, including the creation of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Glacier Peak Wilderness, William O. Douglas Wilderness (Cougar Lakes Wilderness Area), Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Mt. Baker Wilderness, Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, and others. The NCCC has also collaborated with British Columbia allies to block the raising of Ross Dam and to encourage the establishment of a U.S.-Canadian international park. In addition, the NCCC newsletter, The Wild Cascades, has kept its members and other conservationists informed of and dedicated to the various issues affecting the North Cascades. The North Cascades Conservation Council has been a leader in the protection and preservation of the North Cascades mountain range from the Columbia River to the U.S.-Canadian border. Â¶ "

In 1964, Seattle Beautiful Inc. named her Citizen of the Year, for her tireless work with the organization, which promoted public parks, boulevard plantings, and programs that enhanced neighborhood beautification.Â¶ Once their youngest child was in college, Myrtle went back to school at the University of Washington to get her degree in political science, and got into politics. In 1955, she was appointed to the Seattle City Council and elected a year later. She later served as president of the City Council. In each of her election when the council was still elected at large, she received the most votes, and, during the 1964 election, she received more votes than any other council candidate had ever received. Â¶ She was very committed to parks and green spaces and worked to make these spaces an integral part of the city. She was also a strong supporter of the arts, and was most proud of the remodeled Opera House and the various theaters on its campus. Myrtle Edwards died unexpectedly due to injuries sustained in a car accident in 1969. To honor her legacy, the former Elliot Bay Park was renamed Myrtle Edwards Park. The park was a former dumping ground for construction and industrial projects, and was transformed into a waterfront park overlooking Puget Sound, which were the kinds of project she supported throughout her career.Â¶ Â¶ "

Swan was born in Massachusetts in 1818 and married Mathilda Loning in 1841. He left his wife and two children in 1850, heading to gold rush San Francisco. In 1852 Swan departed for Shoalwater Bay (now called Grays Harbor). He learned the Chinook jargon, and this knowledge led Washington Governor Isaac Stevens to pick Swan as one of several translators for treaty negotiations with the Indians of Western Washington during 1854 and 1855. Swan then returned east and wrote a book, The Northwest Coast; or, Three Years' Residence in Washington Territory. He later worked as Isaac Stevens's personal secretary when Stevens served his first term as the Washington Territory's delegate to the U.S. Congress in 1857 and 1858. Â¶ When Congress adjourned, Swan returned to Washington. He spent the next three years shuttling back and forth between Port Townsend and the Makah Indian Reservation at Neah Bay, supporting himself by writing for a variety of newspapers. In 1862 the local U.S. Indian agent appointed Swan the first schoolteacher at the Makah Reservation. Swan supervised construction of the school while convincing Makah parents to send their children there. Believing in acculturation yet still valuing native ways, Swan taught English, farming, and sewing in his school. He was well liked and respected by the Makah. Swan, who was probably the first white person to learn the Makah language, spent his spare time writing an ethnography of the Makah, later published by the Smithsonian Institution. Under criticism for failing to teach Christianity to the Makah, Swan resigned in 1866 and moved to Port Townsend. Â¶ Swan was admitted to the bar in 1867 and began practicing admiralty law. The following year he was appointed to the Pilotage Commission of Puget Sound, the agency which examined sea pilots and issued licenses. In 1882 he became a U.S. commissioner (district court judge). He also took the postition of Hawaiian consul to the United States at Port Townsend in 1882. Swan held these jobs for the rest of his life, but he was not particularly fond of them. They paid poorly, and Swan frequently took leaves of absence to go in search of adventure. He worked as a special agent for the Northern Pacific Railway from 1867 to 1871, surveying potential terminuses. (Not surprisingly, he recommended Port Townsend). The Smithsonian Institution hired Swan to collect Indian artifacts for the 1876 world's fair in Philadelphia, the 1884 fair in London, and the 1893 exposition in Chicago. The Smithsonian thus funded Swan's collecting trips to British Columbia and Southeast Alaska in 1875 and 1883. Swan published two articles on the Haida Indians from the notes he took on these trips. An appointment as deputy customs collector for Neah Bay allowed Swan to live at the Makah reservation from 1878 to 1881. The U.S. Fish Commission asked Swan to write a series of reports on the fish and fisheries of the northern Pacific, permitting him to visit Neah Bay intermittently between 1882 and 1891. Swan spent the rest of his life in Port Townsend, dying there in 1900. Â¶ "

After turning himself in, Hirabayashi appealed to the Supreme Court, but failed to win his case.Â¶ Fisher did not give up her interest in the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans after the war ended. For almost two decades after the war she conducted historical research, mostly from her Seattle area residence, to write a book about the incarceration. During this period she published part of her work in a bi-weekly newspaper called the Reporter. She also continued to advocate for Japanese Americans who did not receive just compensation for their treatment and for the possessions they lost during their incarceration. In the early 1950s Fisher also lobbied against the appointment of Earl Warren to the U.S. Supreme Court because of his wartime role in the Japanese American incarceration.Â¶ After almost two decades of research and trying to find a publisher, Fisher's book, Exile of a Race, was published in 1965. Exile of a Race argues strongly that there was never any evidence that Japanese Americans posed a threat and that all Americans should see the incarceration as evidence of the frailty of civil liberties in the U.S.Â¶ In the immediate postwar years Fisher also continued to advocate her leftist political beliefs and worked as a reporter for the Call a weekly socialist newspaper.

2027-004,"Garfield, Viola Edmundson, 1899-1983",Viola Edmundson Garfield diploma,"A young Viola Edmundson, too frightened to walk alone past a field of cows on the way to the schoolhouse, soon abandoned her first attempt at grade school. By the time she had turned twenty-two, however, the timid girl had grown up into an adventurous young woman. In August of 1922, Viola accepted a job from the Bureau of Indian Affairs teaching Tsimshian Indian children in a remote Alaskan village. Years later she described that \""my first view of the Tsimshian was of rows of houses spaced along the meandering shores of New Metlakatla, Alaska. Approaching the island in a late August afternoon, Purple Mountain and Yellow Hill with their brilliant colors dwarfed the weathered homes and churches.\"" Accompanying her were five other teachers and the superintendent. Viola was one of only two in the group who had met an Indian previously, and her interactions with a few Salish Indians on Whidbey Island while growing up had been very limited. And regardless of prior experience, \""none of us had known such people as the Metlakatlans.\"" The nine-month teaching assignment would define her life and work from that moment forward. Â¶ Born on December 5th, 1899 in Iowa, Viola moved with her family to Whidbey Island in 1905. Once an added year and the company of a younger sister provided the courage to brave the frightening gauntlet of cows, she thrived in school--gaining back the lost year by skipping the fourth grade--and graduated valedictorian of her high school class. She worked and saved for a year, and entered the University of Washington in 1919. Unfortunately, her money ran out during her second year, necessitating a transfer to the Bellingham Normal School. Shortly after earning a teaching certificate, she left for New Metlakatla. Â¶ When she arrived, many adult Metlakatlans had been among those who had helped build the village, and only the youngest had no memory of its founder. These settlers had left their ancestral homeland, and vowed to renounce their ancient customs in favor of approximating the white man's culture. For this reason, they had a reputation among whites as being the most \""progressive\"" of all Northwest Coast Indian tribes. Despite the sincere effort to assimilate, she noted that \""in many ways the Metlakatlans displayed attitudes, beliefs and behavior that were foreign and incomprehensible to the teachers.\"" The Indian children, for example, would not compete for attention or for rewards because, she realized, they thought in terms of group, and not personal, interest. The uniqueness of the Indians and their culture fascinated the young Viola. Despite the superintendent's injunction, she refused to punish children who spoke Tsimshian. Â¶ This initial immersion in Indian culture ended with the school year the following spring. She returned to Seattle and worked as a stenographer for the city's Chamber of Commerce. Here she met Charles Darwin Garfield, an Alaskan who had founded the Seattle Fur Exchange, and they married on her twenty-fifth birthday. Her curiosity about Indian culture slumbered dormant until 1927, when she was able once again to attend the University of Washington. She majored in sociology, and renewed her interest in the Tsimshian under the influence of newly-arrived anthropologist Melville Jacobs. She returned to New Metlakatla to study Tsimshian marriage patterns for her Master's Degree, which she received in 1931. For the next several years, she would alternate between spending summers at Columbia University in pursuit of doctoral studies and the rest of the year teaching at the University of Washington. At Columbia, she studied under Franz Boas, generally credited with being the \""father of American anthropology.\"" Like many other early Northwest anthropologists, she maintained throughout her long career the Boasian dedication to ethnographic detail and native texts. At the time Columbia required the publication of the dissertation before granting a Ph.D. Even though Garfield finished hers in 1935, she had to wait until the 1939 publication of Tsimshian Clan and Society before receiving her degree. Once she had the Ph.D., she joined the University of Washington as a full faculty member, where she would teach until her retirement in 1970. Â¶ Garfield formed a crucial part of the nucleus of a department internationally famous for its specialization in Northwest Coast Indian culture. French anthropologist Claude LÃ©vy-Strauss, for example, relied upon Tsimshian examples drawn from Garfield in his early studies of kinship and mythology. Outside academia, Garfield was most famous for her work on totem poles. She worked with the United States Forest Service (U.S.F.S.) to restore many Alaskan totem poles, and together with Linn A. Forrest, a U.S.F.S. regional architect and supervisor of the restoration project, wrote The Wolf and the Raven: Totem Poles of Southeastern Alaska in 1948. She also wrote a history of the famous Seattle totem pole in Pioneer Square. Garfield's research illustrated how the poles are not just intricately crafted, beautiful works of art, but sophisticated symbols created by the Indians to tell of family, history and mythology. Â¶ Viola Edmundson Garfield died in 1983, after spending a life studying, promoting and trying to preserve the art and culture of Northwest Coast Indians.

During that time he had a significant role in Seattle's history. Â¶ Matthews's life reflects many of the currents and tensions that prevailed in America from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of the Second World War. He was deeply aware of the change in America from a rural orientation to an urban and industrialized one. Involved with the progressive movement, he found the implications of the First World War and the radical labor movement in Seattle threatening. In this context Matthews fought to make the Church a moving force within society and preserve his concept of religious orthodoxy. This led him to become a proponent of fundamentalism and an opponent of modernism within the Presbyterian church. Â¶ Born in Calhoun, Georgia, on September 24, 1867, Matthews received his formal education at the town's local academy. He was ordained there in 1887, and after brief ministries in Calhoun and Dalton, Georgia, he accepted a ministry in Jackson, Tennessee. Clearly part of the social gospel movement, Matthews attempted to adapt the church to urban conditions. During his years in Jackson, 1896-1901, he was instrumental in building a hospital, organizing a night school, and founding a local humane society. His work as an organizer and preacher earned him an honorary doctorate from Tennessee Normal University and soon after, a call to become minister to Seattle's First Presbyterian Church. Â¶ Matthews viewed himself as a progressive with the dual mission of expanding his church and rooting out the corruption prevalent in Seattle at that time. Membership in his congregation grew to ten thousand, the largest Presbyterian church in the world. At the same time, he waged active campaigns against Seattle mayors, police chiefs, business leaders, saloon keepers, and others whom he perceived as evil. Â¶ By 1912 Matthews had been elected moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. This led to a close association with Woodrow Wilson, and Matthews became a frequent guest at the White House. As Wilson's devoted follower, Matthews began to consider opponents of Wilson as well as Seattle's radical labor leaders in the International Woodworkers of the World grave threats to the security of the nation. Consequently he became increasingly conservative, calling for restriction of immigration and repressive measures in the context of the red scare of the 1920s, and increasingly strident in his support for such issues as Prohibition, fundamentalism, and William Jennings Bryan's crusade against the teaching of evolution. Strongly opinionated, Matthews made many enemies, but he also had thousands of devoted followers. While his theology was relatively simple, his life reveals the complexity of forces working in America as this Southerner in the Pacific Northwest attempted to lead Seattle to his own particular vision of righteousness.Â¶ "

Captain William Renton founded it in 1863 on Bainbridge Island, directly across from Seattle in the Puget Sound. Within a year the mill was turning out 50,000 board feet a day. The PBMCo expanded rapidly, as did the timber industry in Washington territory generally. (In the 1880s, the territory's annual timber production soared from 160 million board feet to over a billion). Although the California market was the most crucial, the PBMCo shipped its lumber throughout the Pacific Rim. The PBMCo briefly tried to enter the European market, but the long voyage around South America posed too great of a logistical challenge for consistent shipments to Europe. Â¶ In 1876, Renton incorporated the company in San Francisco with new partner Charles S. Holmes. Prior to 1885, the PBMCo obtained all its logs by contract with independent operators, since Renton did not want to take on either the additional risk or capital investment of logging camps. The decreasing supply of accessible high-quality lumber and the steady inflation in log prices led him to change his policy. He noted in 1864 that timber \""contiguous to the Sound is nearly exhausted.\"" The company purchased land north of Olympia, and constructed the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor Railroad to transport the logs. By 1891, the company held 80,000 acres of timber land. A fire destroyed the mill in 1888, but a new one, larger and more efficient, was in operation within the year. Â¶ The PBMCo would face other stiff challenges in the 1890s, and would do so without the guidance of Renton, who died in 1891. A devastating depression swept the United States in 1893, forcing the company to operate in a hostile economic climate. It also faced increased competition from eastern mills moving into the Pacific Northwest. The St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company managed to rival PBMCo's position as the largest mill in the region during the 1890s. Weyerhaeuser entered the region in 1900, purchasing 900,000 acres of timberland. The PBMCo became increasingly ill-suited for competition with firms better located for participation in the rail and cargo trades. Â¶ In February 1903 Renton's heirs sold the company to two men from Michigan, David E. Skinner and John W. Eddy. The mill burned again in 1907, and the one built to replace it was much smaller. By 1912, the new mill operated only sporadically. Demands generated by the First World War temporarily returned the mill's economic viability; after the war, the demand crashed, and so did the mill's brief economic resurgence. Eddy and Skinner closed it in 1922 and divided the PBMCo's assets. The defunct mill was dismantled in 1924. Eddy bought out Skinner in that same year, and from that point forward the PBMCo relied upon its timber holdings and was exclusively an Eddy family concern. Â¶ "

Through its mission \""to protect, restore, and sustain Washington's environment for all,\"" the organization has served as a coordinating body on issues of statewide significance. Among other achievements, the WEC has worked to enforce and pass the State Environmental Policy Act, the State Superfund Law, the Growth Management Act, and the Shoreline Management Act. It also operates the Environmental Priorities Coalition and the Voter Education Program. Throughout its history, the organization has also focused on other issues related to carbon pollution, clean energy, water pollution, forests, and public lands.Â¶ In 1986 and 1987, the WEC was heavily involved with the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Implementation Project, which was the result of negotiations between the timber industry, the four natural resource agencies in Washington State, Indian tribes, and environmentalists. The Project is a cooperative plan for managing forest harvest practices on both state and private timberlands. Marcy Golde was involved with the negotiations, while Lisa Lombardy served as the WEC's statewide coordinator. Other WEC staff, through private funding, monitored timber harvest applications.Â¶ Another major legal case in which the WEC was involved concerned Washington State rules that imposed requirements on the design, equipment, reporting, and operations of oil tankers. Washington State, with the help of the WEC, defeated the trade association Intertanko, which represented operators of oil tanker ships. In 2000, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision on the basis that federal law pre-empts state rules. Â¶ "

0038-001,"Cotterill, George F. (George Fletcher), 1865-1958",George F. Cotterill papers,"Civil servant, elected official, moral reformer, surveyor, and engineer, George Fletcher Cotterill helped shape the city of Seattle in the literal as well as the figurative sense. Â¶ Cotterill was born in England to Alice and Robert Cotterill on Nov. 18, 1865. In 1872, the Cotterill family immigrated to the United States and settled in Montclair, New Jersey. Cotterill graduated from high school as class valedictorian in 1881, and studied surveying and engineering under the tutelage of a New Jersey county engineer for the next three years. During this time he participated in the platting and construction of Arlington cemetery. Â¶ Cotterill migrated to the Pacific Northwest in 1884. For several years he worked as a surveyor on various land, mining, and railroad projects before being hired by surveyor R.H. Thomson. With Thomson, Cotterill surveyed for the city's first sewer system and platted additions to rapidly expanding Seattle. When Thomson was appointed city engineer in 1882, Cotterill became his assistant. Among his responsibilities as assistant city engineer, Cotterill was assigned to the city water department and became instrumental in the development of the Cedar River water supply. The city, needing a fresher and less expensive source of water than the Lake Washington pumping system, approved the Cedar River gravity system in the mid 1890s. At the time, the city was out of funds to pay for the new water system, and Cotterill, a member of the task force responsible for improving Seattle's water supply, proposed the novel revenue bond system for municipal ownership of public utilities. The first of its kind in the United States, this public utilities plan was approved by citizen vote in 1896. Cotterill was also involved in the project to convert the tide flats south of the city into property capable of development. Â¶ Cotterill's advocacy of public utilities drew him into the political arena. In 1900 the nonpartisan party, through which he was promoting public utilities, nominated him for mayor. Cotterill accepted the nomination contingent on backing from the Democratic Party, which he received, and he ran as a Democratic candidate. Though Cotterill had grown up a Republican, the recent campaign of William Jennings Bryan had made him a Democrat. Cotterill did not win this election or the next, but in 1906 he ran for the state senate and won. One of his principal accomplishments while in office was the framing of the successful amendment to the Washington State constitution recognizing female suffrage. Because of this amendment, he recalled later with pride, his mother had been able to cast a ballot for the first time at the age of 75. Cotterill received the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 1908 and again in 1910, but lost both times. Â¶ In 1912 Cotterill again ran for mayor, this time on a platform demanding moral reform. In an \""open\"" city where vice had flourished since the Klondike gold rush, his campaign targeted Hiram Gill's legacy of graft in city government as well as rampant prostitution and gambling houses. Cotterill won this election, helped in part by the new ability of women to vote. Cotterill's term was punctuated by conflict and controversy, due to corruption in municipal government and the police department, labor unrest, an unsympathetic Seattle Times, and other causes. He regularly confronted opposition to his moral reform agenda, which was for the most part driven by strong temperance beliefs. Â¶ At the center of Cotterill's commitment to moral reform was his life-long crusade on behalf of temperance. His parents had joined the United Kingdom Temperance Alliance in 1865, consequently indoctrinating Cotterill from birth. As a child in England, Cotterill attended the local chapter his mother had formed of the Band of Hope, an organization for children's temperance education. Cotterill attended his first convention of the International Order of Good Templars in 1897 and remained involved in this organization for the rest of his life. He served for a time as Grand Secretary of the Washington State division and later as Chief Templar of the national division. In addition to his work with the Templars, he was a member of the Anti-Saloon League. In 1909, Cotterill was appointed by President Taft as U.S. representative to the International Congress against Alcoholism; in 1913 President Wilson reappointed him. Â¶ Cotterill did not seek a second term as mayor; instead he worked as a surveyor and engineer in private practice. From 1916 to 1919 he served as chief engineer of the state Highway Department. He returned to Seattle politics in 1922, running for Seattle port commissioner. He won, and served four consecutive three-year terms, 1922 to 1934. Â¶ Following his port commissioner post, Cotterill ran unsuccessfully for at least five various city and state offices between 1932 and 1951. He also ran for governor in 1928. Besides these campaigns, Cotterill worked a variety of jobs. Many of these were temporary positions, such as his position as consultant to the State Planning Council, and Cotterill faced some financial difficulty during the depression. He met with marginal success in his endeavors to get work under the WPA, in large part due to his advanced age. But Cotterill kept working, retiring at 84 only because he was forced out of his job as draftsman in the King County Assessor's office by a new county regulation of compulsory retirement for all employees over 70. Â¶ Cotterill was also active civically. He was a founding member of the Queen City Good Roads Club, and served as chairman of the paths committee. He was responsible for designing, surveying, and laying out over 25 miles of bicycle paths throughout Seattle, which became the basis of the city's boulevard system. He also wrote on Seattle and Northwest history, and in 1928 he published The Climax of a World Quest, a history of Puget Sound. Â¶ Cotterill's entire immediate family eventually migrated to the Puget Sound area. Cotterill married Cora Gormley in 1890, and in 1892 daughter Ruth was born. Ruth died in 1900, and George and Cora had no more children of their own. They did, however, raise a niece, Marjorie Avery nee Smith, as a foster daughter. Cora died in 1936 and Cotterill later married Katherine Owens. He died in 1958, at 92Â¶ "

Graduate and Professional Student Senate,"University of Washington, Graduate and Professional Student Senate records","The Graduate and Professional Student Senate was originally formed as a subdivision of the Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW) in 1965 as the Joint Committee on Graduate Planning. In 1967, the student body approved the ASUW constitutional amendment which designated the GPSS as the representative body for graduate and professional students and the ASUW as the representative body for undergraduates. At the same time, graduate students retained the right to belong to the ASUW and to participate in ASUW activities Â¶ The Senate consists of representatives from all UW degree-granting units that choose to elect them and each unit may elect up to two senators, usually during the autumn quarter for one-year terms. The Senate annually elects four officers: a President, a Vice-President, a Secretary, and a Treasurer. Each officer receives a salary equivalent to a Teaching Assistant stipend and works 19.5 hours per week. The Senate also employs other staff members including an office manager, legislative assistant, publications assistant, and assistants to the president and treasurer. Four senators are appointed annually to organize and chair issue-specific ad hoc committees and, together with the four officers and an ASUW Board of Control member, form the Executive Committee. The Committee is responsible for representing the Senate before the University administration, acting as the governing body of the GPSS when the Senate is not in session, implementing the Senate's decisions, and providing continuity and leadership for the Senate and its activities Â¶ The Senate is primarily an advocacy organization concerned with improving the quality of graduate and professional student life by working to maintain academic freedom for students, improving the quality of graduate instruction, developing and maintaining student representation through appointments to University decision-making committees, and ensuring that quality student services are maintained at the UW. Historically, the GPSS has addressed problems such as tuition and fee increases, the need for increased diversity programming, access to childcare facilities at affordable prices, and state residency requirements. The meetings of the full Senate are run on a modified agenda system, in which senators who wish to present a motion, resolution, or report requiring Senate action are asked to submit it to the Secretary two weeks prior to the Senate meeting so that it may be circulated to the Senate members before the meeting. Ad hoc committees handle a large amount of the prepatory work and research specific issues of concern to graduate students in order to clarify and define them before presenting concrete proposals for action before the Senate Â¶ "

Branch No. 304 (Seattle, Wash.)",Workmen's Circle/Der Arbeter Ring Branch 304 Records,"In April of 1892, a group of Jewish garment workers from New York City's Lower East Side formed a mutual aid society called the Workingmen's Circle. This small collective soon grew to a membership of 300, and it officially became known as the Workmen's Circle (Der Arbeter Ring in Yiddish) in 1900. The Workmen's Circle provided benefits that poor immigrants were otherwise denied: life insurance, health benefits, unemployment relief, homes for the aged, and funeral assistance. By 1920 there were over 80,000 members, and The Workmen's Circle had become one of the largest Jewish organizations in America. Â¶ The programs initiated by the Workmen's Circle encompassed a host of social, cultural, and political issues deemed important to the Jewish community. In addition to promoting labor rights and the strengthening of trade unions, the organization provided educational and cultural programs that emphasized Jewish heritage through theater, music, literature, summer camps, and Yiddish instruction. The Workmen's Circle also sold war bonds to provide support during both World Wars, and partnered with other Jewish organizations to actively promote and fund the settlement and expansion of Israel during the early years of its existence. After World War II, the organization de-emphasized their socialist leanings in an effort to distance themselves from communist affiliation. Â¶ The Seattle, Washington branch of the Workmen's Circle -- Branch 304 -- was organized in 1909, and their first location was a rented store on 14th Avenue and Main Street. In 1920, the members bought a building at 120 21st Avenue that had previously been a blacksmith shop. Property was then purchased for the organization at 1614 East Union Street in 1937, with the grand opening of this location taking place in December 1942. Activities in Seattle included summer picnics, festive observances of Jewish holidays, New Years Eve celebrations, banquets, and lectures. Though Branch 304 eventually closed its doors in 1973, the Workmen's Circle organization continues to operate in several cities across the country. Â¶ "

The son of a Polish immigrant, he was born in Greenville, Michigan in 1879. A Mayan scholar from youth onward, he graduated from the University of Michigan in 1900 with a Ph.B. in medieval French. With a natural flair for languages, he commanded also German, Spanish and Polish. He learned Russian on his own, and served in the Diplomatic Corps during World War I. What began as a casual meeting with the curator of the Peabody Museum as a youth blossomed into an intellectual fluency with colonial and contemporary Mayan life.

1930-021,Young Women's Christian Association (University of Washington),Young Women's Christian Association (UW) records,"The University of Washington Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) was established in 1895 by Ella Chamberlain, head of the English department. It was the first women's organization on campus and was organized before the incorporation of the national YWCA in 1906. In its early years, the UW YWCA was mostly a religious organization, offering Bible study groups, and devotional and missionary meetings. Throughout the 1910s, members volunteered to perform mission work and teach English to Japanese immigrants in local settlement houses. In 1916 the tenth anniversary of the national YWCA's founding was celebrated through the national jubilee. Â¶ In 1930 after the State Legislature prohibited religious organizations from being housed on the University campus, the UW YWCA moved off campus. In 1940 it merged with the UW YMCA and the two organizations operated jointly for the next thirty years . The UW YMCA-YWCA were housed in Eagleson Hall from 1940 to 1964. Eagleson Hall was sold to the University of Washington in 1964, and a new, spacious building was completed in 1965 at 4525 19th Ave. N.E. Â¶ In 1962 UW denied a campus group space for a talk by Gus Hall, general secretary of the American Communist Party. Students petitioned the UW YMCA-YWCA for rental use of Eagleson Hall, which was granted after much debate. The decision to allow a Communist speaker use YMCA-YWCA resources sparked immediate outrage and support. Members of the general public, students, faculty, and other YMCA-YWCA executives voiced their opinions through phone calls, letters, and newspaper articles. Some believed in the upholding of freedom of speech ; others were outraged by the \""unAmerican\"" and \""un-Christian\"" nature of the Communist Party. The topic of Hall's speech was the McCarran Internal Security Act (1950), which required registration of Communist party members and attempted to criminalize the party. Elizabeth Jackson and Frank Mark, respective executive directors for the UW YMCA-YWCA, made the difficult decision to allow Hall a speaking platform. (Elizabeth Jackson later went on to head the Western Region of the National Student YWCA.) After the controversial event, the organizations drafted an open platform policy, affirming their commitment to freedom of speech and intellectual pursuit. Throughout the 1960s, speakers and forums were sponsored by the UW YMCA-YWCA on diverse topics such as LSD use, the beatnik or \""fringie\"" problem on University Way, capital punishment, racism, and birth control. Â¶ 1970 was a pivotal year for the UW YWCA, marking its declaration of autonomy from the YMCA and subsequent move to 4224 University Way N.E. The effects of the second wave of the women's movement can be seen in its motivation for independent status, namely its commitment to \""the development of a separate, visible identity of self-determining women-not identical to, but equal to men.\"" Over the course of a decade, the UW YWCA pioneered feminist programming, providing an extensive range of services and activities not only for UW students but also for women throughout the Seattle area. Many of the UW YWCA's programs were considered radical or controversial , and pushed the understanding of what a YWCA meant for women and a community. Â¶ The Abortion Birth Control (ABC) Referral Service was formed after a UW student group, the Committee for Abortion Reform , was ordered off campus for advocating passage of a 1970 abortion reform bill (Referendum 20) in Washington State. ABC found a home at the UW YWCA, disbanding as a politically-focused group and reforming as a support service. The ABC Referral Service provided doctor referrals, counseling and advocacy to women considering abortion procedures, as well as birth control methods, and a range of other reproductive health topics. ABC staff regularly visited the offices of doctors providing abortions and gathered information from abortion patients about their experiences to ensure the quality of their referrals. Â¶ Another UW YWCA program centered on women's health. Aradia Clinic opened in 1972 after a year of organizing. The clinic was built by over sixty women under the leadership of a female architect. Aradia strongly encouraged patients to take their health into their own hands. Aradia staff offered annual examinations, pregnancy detection and counselling , and other medical services, as well as self-health classes, workshops, and abortion procedures. In 1973, Aradia sponsored the Third World Women Family Planning Needs Assessment Project. Several community groups, including EI Centro de la Raza and Planned Parenthood, encouraged Aradia to research the need for family planning services within Seattle's ethnic communities. The project's objective was to determine what family planning services were needed and how those needs could be met. Information was gathered from family planning clinics, ethnic service centers, and a sampling of women from each community. The report was completed in 1974 and included extensive demographic material and a list of recommendations. In 1973, Aradia legally separated from the YWCA in order to release the Board of Directors from responsibility for Aradia's actions, although it continued to be housed in the UW YWCA building until 1978. As of 2005, it operates as the Aradia Women's Health Center, and has remained committed to providing feminist health care for women. Â¶ The Lesbian Resource Center began as the Gay Women's Resource Center in 1971 after a UW YWCA staff member took a course on homosexuality at the UW Experimental College and recognized a need in the community. The LRC was a peer counseling center that prpvidea support services to lesbians in the Seattle-King County area. As well as providing individual counseling , a lending library, and a speaker's bureau, discussion \""rap\"" groups were offered. The LRC also worked to make changes within the UW YWCA, pushing for more lesbian membership on the Board of Directors. The LRC became independent from the UW YWCA in 1980. It gained non-profit status under the name Pacific Women's Resources but continued to offer services as the LRC. As of 2005, the LRC is still active in Seattle. Â¶ Mechanica began as a women's co-operative garage and auto mechanics course in 1972. By 1975, it had evolved into a skilled trades information service for women seeking to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades and other nontraditional jobs. As well as providing job counseling , Mechanica staff promoted affirmative action hiring of women and ethnic minorities and pushed for affirmative action placements in union apprenticeships. They worked hard to persuade the University of Washington to adopt a 12% goal for women on UW construction sites. Off campus, Mechanica worked as a consultant to the City of Seattle and King County to help them reach affirmative action goals. It also worked with Federal Contract Compliance officers to push local private companies to hire women. Mechanica lost funding in1980, and the program was converted into a Women's Employment Service. Â¶ Women in Trades (WIT) emerged out of Mechanica as an advocacy group for equal employment opportunites for women and people of color in the trades. In operation by 1976, WIT was an organization of working women employed in bluecollar jobs in the production, maintenance, and construction industries. They were dedicated to establishing legal action for the enforcement of affirmative action goals on a local and national level. Together with Mechanica, WIT negotiated with the Port of Seattle and local unions to ensure they met affirmative action hiring guidelines. WIT also offered support groups and legal support for tradeswomen . WIT was defunct by 1979, but the annual Women in Trades Fair started by Mechanica in 1979 still continues. Â¶ Rape Relief was formed in 1972 following a speakout on rape on the UW campus. Rape Relief provided a 24-hour crisis line for victims of sexual assault and their allies, as well as medical and legal advocacy . Rape Relief staff promoted community education about rape by speaking to junior high and high school students, as well as to various adult community groups. Projects designed for developmentally disabled people, ethnic communities and non-English speaking victims were created. Rape Relief also conducted sensitivity training for police in Washington, Oregon and Alaska . Rape Relief became independent in 1980 and continued to operate as Seattle Rape Relief until financial problems forced its closure in 1999. Â¶ Serve Our Sisters (SOS) was formed in 1970 by two Seattle feminists and was modeled on a temporary, feminist, emergency housing service for women in crisis in New York City. In 1972, SOS became part of the UW YWCA, obtaining a much-needed central telephone. SOS provided women with housing, referrals, a telephone crisis line, and emotional support. Local referral agencies, such as the Open Door Clinic and Harborview Emergency Room, also used SOS's services. By 1974, SOS was no longer an active. Â¶ The Third World Women's Resource Center opened in the summer of 1973 as part of the UW YWCA's attempt to implement the One Imperative to Eliminate Racism. The One Imperative was a National YWCA policy which pushed for \""the elimination of racism wherever it exists and by any means necessary.\"" One of the main purposes of the Center was to provide educational material for all women struggling with the intersections of racism, sexism and economic oppression. The Center was developed and coordinated by Third World women, or women of color. Counseling, classes, rap groups, a library, a speaker's bureau, and a referral service were offered, and there were also efforts to interact with incarcerated women of color. The Center was no longer active by 1976. The failure of the UW YWCA to implement the One Imperative successfully caused tension among staff and Board members. Â¶ Women in Midstream (WI M) was started as the Ad-Hoc Committee on Menopause in 1972 by several middle-aged women who served on the Board of Directors and saw the need for a program dedicated to older women's health, particularly on the topic of menopause. WIM sent out questionnaires about women's personal experiences dealing with symptoms, treatments and the medical field. Due to a small amount of unexpected national publicity, women from around the United States participated and looked to WIM as a resource on menopause. A WIM volunteer, Jane Page wrote a book The Other Awkward Age utilizing the questionnaire results and contributing a much-needed woman's perspective on menopause. WIM was no longer in operation by 1979. Â¶ Women's Divorce Cooperative (WDC) began operating in 1971 as a cooperative of women interested in learning more about divorce law and how to file for divorce without hiring a lawyer. The WDC became an official UW YWCA program in 1975. In its early years, WDC volunteers provided sessions in pro se divorce procedures, as well as referrals to lawyers, counselors, and other agencies for further help in securing a divorce. Telephone and in-person counseling were also available to help women cope emotionally with a divorce. The WDC separated from the UW YWCA in 1980 to regain financial control and restore a cooperative philosophy. Â¶ The feminist spirit inherent in the UW YWCA's programming can also be seen in internal organizational changes. In the two years following its independence from the UW YMCA, the staff structure shifted from a hierarchical to a co-director model, in which three adminstrators received equal pay. The Co-Directorship was seen as a more egalitarian power structure. Evaluation of the model began in 1975, and in 1976, the Board of Directors voted to return to an Executive Coordinator model. The Executive Coordinator was responsible for agency supervision, staff development and supervision , fiscal management, liasion with the Board, and coordination with the community services. Many staff members were displeased with the restructuring; some did not feel included in the decision-making process and others did not believe the model fit into a feminist organiza tion. Â¶ In 1980, the UW YWCA was evicted from University Way and moved away from the UW campus to Northlake. They remained at 701 NE Northlake Way until 1988 and continued to \""struggle for peace and justice, freedom and dignity for all people ,\"" as stated by the National YWCA purpose. The UW YWCA was still active in 1995 on the UW campus, though they may have become defunct as early as 1996. Â¶ "

0048-001,"Suzzallo, Henry, 1875-1933",Henry Suzzallo papers,"Henry Suzzallo was president of the University of Washington from 1915 to 1926; president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching from 1913 to 1933; arbitrator of the National War Labor Policies Board; and chairman of the Washington State Council of Defence from 1917 to1918. He also worked toward the adoption of better living and working conditions for loggers in the lumber industry. He died in 1933. Â¶ Glenn Hughes, who founded the University of Washington (UW) Dramatic Art Department under Henry Suzzallo, described him as \""a brilliant man, small and dynamic--the Napoleon of higher education.\"" The characterization was apt; Suzzallo's career was marked by both tremendous achievement and bitter controversies. He was born in 1875 to Croatian immigrants. Following a sickly childhood, Suzzallo began college at the State Normal School in his home town of San Jose, California, lacking both the money and the grades to attend his first choice, Stanford. After two years he graduated, taking a teaching job in a two-room school in Alviso, California. His degree from the Normal School and money from teaching removed the academic and financial barriers, allowing him to attend Stanford. For the next eighteen years, Suzzallo would shuffle between Stanford and Columbia, first pursuing his education, and later as a faculty member at both institutions. During this time, he managed to win himself an increasingly prestigious reputation. When the UW began searching for a new president in 1914, Suzzallo's name was on the short list of candidates. Â¶ In 1914, the UW was a small frontier college undergoing the first growing pains of becoming a major university. It claimed an enrollment of more than 3,000 students, small by the standards of the major American universities of the time, but still a tremendous increase over previous years. It also suffered from a less-than-robust budget. James R. Angell, the Regents' first choice for president, declined the job, primarily because he considered the UW underfunded. Suzzallo was the Regents' second choice, and he accepted the challenge. Even though money never flowed freely, he did prove remarkably adept at squeezing funding from both private donors and the Legislature. Plans for a magnificent new library, patterned after a medieval cathedral, symbolized his success in expanding the size of the campus and the prestige of the university. (The library would eventually bear his name). During this time, enrollment had burgeoned to over 10,000. Suzzallo further augmented his stature in the state during World War I, when he was president of the Washington Council of Defense, which had primary responsibility for the state's war effort. The \""Napoleon of higher education\"" was not to be spared his Waterloo, however. Â¶ The 1924 election of governor Roland Hartley would shatter the relative calm of Suzzallo's presidency. Hartley won on a platform promising government retrenchment and lower taxes. He also had a record of long-standing antagonism towards the UW, which he saw as a hotbed of socialism. \""Education is a fine thing,\"" he acknowledged, \""but that is not all there is to the game of life.\"" The year of the election, Suzzallo had published his book Our Faith in Education, written primarily to present the case for higher education against those who wanted to limit it in favor of tax reduction. Not surprisingly, Hartley's parsimony quickly conflicted with Suzzallo's educational vision. Suzzallo's high salary--$18,000 a year, larger than any other state official--made him and the University especially vulnerable to attack. Not only did Hartley want to curtail university expenditures, he also proposed overhauling the funding and administration system for the state's colleges and universities. Suzzallo did nothing to hide his strong objections to the governor's agenda. The battle spread to the Legislature and the Board of Regents, both Suzzallo allies. Each camp insisted adamantly, if implausibly, that it represented a political virtue intent on rescuing higher education from the political machinations of its opponents. Â¶ Hartley overcame the obstacle of the recalcitrant Regents by removing members supportive of Suzzallo. The Board, now dominated by Hartley's new appointees, put Suzzallo on indefinite leave-of-absence when he refused to resign. Suzzallo's ouster created a political firestorm, although a petition drive for a gubernatorial recall election, despite early momentum, sputtered, and failed to collect the required number of signatures. Suzzallo was flooded immediately with job offers. He decided to accept election as chairman of the board of the Carnegie Foundation. He remained affiliated with the Carnegie Foundation until complications following a heart attack in Seattle claimed his life on September 25, 1933. Â¶ "

Later the family moved to Spokane where Torrance attended the Longfellow School. His interest in sports started early; he volunteered as a bat boy for the Spokane Indians baseball team. After moving to American Falls, Idaho, at the age of twelve, Torrance joined the American Falls High School baseball team. He attended high school in Spokane, where he was a football player, captain of the baseball team, and was voted \""Yell King.\"" Â¶ In 1918, during WWI, Roscoe Torrance became a student at the University of Washington. He volunteered for the Student Army Training Corps which was created at the University of Washington on October 1, 1918; however, the war ended before his intended training in Oklahoma could begin. While at the UW, Torrance was an athletic property manager for the athletic department, and was president of the Associated Students of the UW. While study body president, he raised funds for the building of a new stadium in 1920. Torrance played on the University's baseball team, which toured Japan during 1921. Â¶ After college, Torrance was employed as freshman baseball coach and assistant graduate manager for the UW athletics department. In 1924, he began to work as a billboard space salesman for Foster & Kleiser Company. In 1931, Torrance and his business partner William H. Seifert bought the Western Printing Company, and in 1938, the two acquired the Wood and Reber Advertising Agency, which later merged with Metropolitan Press. After Metropolitan Press' acquisition by Craftsman Press, Torrance was employed as vice president. Between 1926 and 1936, Torrance served in the Marine Corps Reserve. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he fought in the South Pacific as a member of the 3rd Marine Division, and he earned a Bronze Star. Â¶ Torrance's civic and sports-related activities in Seattle were numerous. As a member of the Washington Athletic Board of Directors, he helped create the 101 Club in 1933, an organization to provide support to athletes. After the purchase of the Seattle Rainiers professional baseball team by Emil Sick, Torrance was hired as executive vice president for the team. He took on this work for a small sum while continuing to work in the printing business. In 1936, Torrance became State Chairman for the March of Dimes and served in that capacity for twenty years. Torrance was also a founder of Greater Seattle, Inc., the originators of Seafair in Seattle. He was crowned King Neptune XIX of Seafair in 1968. In 1962, Torrance and his wife were co-chairs of the Century 21 Exposition's hospitality commitee, hosting such dignitaries as President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Jonas Salk. Torrance chaired the boards of the Western Pacific Insurance Company, the Salvation Army, and the Boys Clubs of America, and was a post commander of the American Legion. He was a member of the National Association of Manufacturers and Association of Washington Industries and a director of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce. In addition, Torrance was a member of the Rainier Club, the Seattle Rotary, Harbor Club, and Nile Temple of the Shriners. Â¶ During the 1950s, Torrance became involved in a public scandal due to his activities raising money for athletes. He was accused of running a \""slush fund\"" that provided University of Washington players with more funding than the maximum financial aid allowed by the Pacific Coast Conference (forty dollars). Torrance and others felt that the maximum amount of funding allowed was far too little to assist the athletes with the cost of living and education. After the controversy, the University of Washington was placed on athletic probation by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the University's teams could not participate in any NCAA championships until the probation concluded. These events caused Torrance to remove himself from his official ties with the UW's athletics department. Â¶ Despite the unpleasantness during the 1950s, Torrance's efforts in supporting the University were honored in 1972 when he received the Distinguished Alumni Special Service Award. The Puget Sound Sportswriters and Sportscasters gave him their Charles E. Sullivan Award in 1974. He was inducted into the UW's Hall of Fame and the Washington State Sports Hall of Fame in 1980. In 1989, Torrance was the first awardee of the annual Seattle-King County Association of Realtors' First Citizen Award. In 2001, he was posthumously inducted into the UW's Baseball All-Century Team. Â¶ Torrance married Ruth Doris Inkster in 1924. The couple had three children, named Shirley, John and William. Â¶ After the death of his wife, Ruth, in 1971, Torrance married Madge True in 1976. He also remained active in the community throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and served as the chairman of the board of the Western Pacific Insurance Company, director of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, post commander of the American Legion, and board member of the Salvation Army and Boys Club of America, and was a member of the National Association of Manufacturers, the Association of Washington Industries, the Rainier Club, the Seattle Rotary, Harbor Club, the Seattle Golf Club, and the Nile Temple.

He was department chair from 1906-1917 and Dean of the Engineering College from 1917-1929. Magnusson believed in having a close relationship with industry and had practicing engineers lecture in his classes. In about 1910 he took a leave of absence for two years to work for the General Electric Company. As a result of his working relationship with GE, the company donated an electric oscillograph in 1913, which lead to the development of a course in electric transients, possibly the first such course to be offered in an American college. In 1919 he proposed building a 230-kv line from the Canadian border to Los Angeles, connecting the three state region; the idea was eventually put into place many years later. A 1932 issue of the University of Washington newspaper noted that Magnusson had won international fame for his studies of Lichtenberg figures.

18-026,Washington Park Arboretum,University of Washington Arboretum records,"Since its inception, the purpose of the University of Washington Arboretum has been to form a collection of trees and plants from around the world as a source for research and public enjoyment. Located south of the school's Seattle campus, the Arboretum is one of the premier arboreta in the United States. Â¶ In the 1890s, after the University of Washington campus moved to its present site, some faculty and administrators envisioned building an arboretum as part of the campus. Their efforts resulted in a collection of trees and plants near where Drumheller Fountain is now located. However, the new campus design, implemented prior to the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909, destroyed the rudimentary collection. Â¶ The plan for the present Arboretum began developing in the early 1920s. The University proposed that Seattle give the school full use of Washington Park and its infrastructure for an arboretum. In 1924, Seattle's Board of Park Commissioners accepted the proposal. However, funding remained poor and little development was accomplished over the next decade. Â¶ Substantial development of the Arboretum did not begin until the public relief programs of the Great Depression provided the necessary resources. From 1935 to 1941, the Federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) played a major role in the Arboretum's development by providing labor and other resources. The Washington Emergency Relief Agency also played a similar but lesser role during the 1930s. Â¶ In addition to public relief agencies, private organizations in the mid-1930s began to provide support. In 1935, the Arboretum Foundation was created to raise an endowment for the maintenance and promotion of the park. Also in 1935, the Seattle Garden Club hired the firm of the Olmsted Bros., of Brookline, Massachusetts, to prepare a master plan. The firm intended their plan to be preliminary, but since its implementation in 1936, this design has endured despite criticism that it uses an outdated system of grouping plants by taxonomy. Â¶ With the official establishment of the Arboretum in 1934, the University named Hugo Winkenwerder, Dean of the College of Forestry, as Acting Director of the Arboretum. However, Winkenwerder still maintained his full workload at the University and in 1938 recommended that a full-time Director be hired. John Hanley became the first full-time Director in 1938 until he resigned in 1948 and was replaced by Brian Mulligan. Mulligan retired in 1972 as the last Director. The position then became the Curator of Plant Collections, which Joseph Witt filled in 1973. Â¶ The end of Depression relief programs and the beginning of World War II meant an end to much of the Arboretum's public support, but in 1945 Washington's state legislature began funding the Arboretum directly. Increased state funding brought administrative changes for the Arboretum, as the University expanded its management power. Since 1935 the University of Washington Arboretum Committee (later called the UW Arboretum Board) had served mainly to provide technical advice. Heeding complaints from members of the campus community who argued that the University should have more control over state funds that went into the park, UW President Lee Paul Sieg made attempts to give the University more control over the Arboretum's operations and diminished the management role of the Foundation. In 1949, the Arboretums budget came under the University's College of Forestry, continuing the trend toward more University management of the park. Â¶ While the Arboretum had managed to acquire land through various deals during the 1930s and 40s, neighboring development reduced some of its space. In 1945, the Seattle Historical Museum (now the Museum of History and Industry) took some land in the northern part of the park. In the early 1950s, the Arboretum lost another 51 acres because of the construction of a second bridge across Lake Washington. Both of these issues incited protest from Arboretum supporters. Â¶ In the 1960s, management of the Arboretum underwent more changes. UW President Charles Odegaard discharged the University Arboretum Advisory Committee and in its place established three new committees: the University Committee on the Arboretum, the City-University Liaison Committee, and the Advisory Committee on Programs for the University of Washington Arboretum. The Arboretum collection itself also changed during this decade, when the privately funded Japanese Garden was completed in 1960. Also in the 1960s, factional conflicts between private Arboretum supporters created a schism. In 1966 an angry faction of the Arboretum Foundation split off from the group and formed the Friends of the Arboretum, which later became the Northwest Horticulture Society (NHS). The NHS helped establish the UW Center for Urban Horticulture (CUH), a teaching and research center built on the campus shore of Union Bay in 1980. Â¶ The most recent administrative change came in the 1980s when the University's Center for Urban Horticulture (CUH) began administering the Arboretum. Â¶ "
1885-001,"Paul, William Lewis, 1885-1977",William Lewis Paul papers,"William Lewis Paul (1885-1977) was a pioneering Indian rights attorney and a leading figure in the campaign for native Alaskan rights. Paul was born in 1885 to parents who both had Tlingit mothers and European fathers. His mother, Matilda Kinnan Paul (Tamaree), was a Presbyterian missionary who worked at the Sitka Industrial Training School. Paul was educated at this school and later at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. He adopted the Carlisle School's assimilationist ideals and its assertion that Indians should have the same rights and privileges as other American citizens. Paul later graduated from Whitworth College in Spokane and studied law through correspondence courses offered by LaSalle University. In 1920 he returned to Alaska. His brother Louis was Grand Secretary of the Alaska Native Brotherhood (ANB), and he convinced William to stay in Alaska and work for the ANB. Â¶ The Paul brothers dominated the ANB from 1920 to 1940. William was elected Grand Secretary in 1920, the same year he passed the bar, making him the first Alaska native attorney. The ANB re-elected him Grand Secretary in 1921, 1922, 1935, 1938, and 1951. He won the office of Grand President in 1928, 1929, and 1955. Louis served as Grand Secretary twice and as Grand President three times between 1919 and 1939. The ANB, founded in 1912 by Tlingit Presbyterians associated with the Sitka Industrial Training School, originally saw its mission as civilizing the Indians of Southeast Alaska. In 1915 the ANB successfully lobbied the territorial legislature to pass a law giving citizenship and voting rights to natives who learned English and held jobs in the cash economy. The Pauls retained the ANB's focus on assimilating and Christianizing Indians. They argued, however, that Alaska natives were already US citizens by birth, and were therefore entitled to the rights and privileges associated with citizenship. The district court finally adopted this position in 1922, when William Paul successfully defended the right of his brother's father-in-law to vote in US vs. Charlie Jones. Â¶ William Paul made the ANB a major force in Alaskan politics. He spent much of the early 1920s organizing new ANB chapters throughout southeast Alaska, boosting membership from 100 in 1920 to 2,200 by 1935. He also started and edited a newspaper, Alaska Fisherman, published in Ketchikan from 1923 to 1932. The paper devoted much of its space to denouncing white cannery owners who monopolized native fishing grounds. William Paul used his newspaper and his ANB connections to great advantage in his successful 1924 and 1926 campaigns for the Alaska legislature, becoming the first native Alaskan to serve in that body. He passed a bill that made Alaska natives eligible to receive assistance under the territory's widows, orphans, and old age pension laws. Paul also fended off a challenge to native voting rights in the form of a literacy test. The law passed, but Paul amended it to exclude from its provisions all those who had previously voted. Without this amendment, the literacy test would have disenfranchised most of the native population. Charges that Paul accepted campaign contributions from canneries cost him his bid for re-election in 1928. He also lost his campaigns for territorial attorney general in 1930 and 1932. Nonetheless, Paul continued his successful private law practice. He tried many Indian rights cases, including one that forced the Ketchikan public schools to accept Indian children in 1929. Â¶ In the mid 1930s, William Paul worked for the ANB in Washington, DC. He authored a bill that allowed the Tlingit and Haida Indians to sue the government in a test case to determine the validity of their land claims; Congress passed this law in 1935. Paul was also instrumental in extending the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) to Alaska in 1936. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) then hired Paul to help villages draft IRA constitutions. Paul, however, suffered several setbacks in the late 1930s. In 1937 the Alaska Bar Association prohibited Paul from practicing law on the grounds that he had defrauded a client. The BIA fired Paul shortly thereafter. Â¶ The ANB was divided sharply over whether to allow William Paul a major role in planning the Tlingit-Haida land claims suit. Paul would not be readmitted to the Bar until January 1959. His disbarment reduced his influence in the ANB, which turned to the rival Peratrovich family for leadership. Nonetheless, the BIA required the Haida and Tlingit to form a joint council to decide how to prosecute the suit and how to distribute the benefits, and Paul was elected head of this council in 1941. The Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska (CCTHITA), founded in 1935, became one of the leading organizations campaigning for native Alaskan rights from the 1940s onwards. Paul's two sons, William Lackey Paul (often referred to as William L. Paul, Jr.) and Louis Frederick Paul (known as Fred Paul), were designated attorneys for the case against the government. The BIA and the Peratroviches removed the Pauls from the case in 1944, hiring instead the nationally known attorney James Curry. Â¶ William Paul dissented from Curry's contention that the Tlingit and Haida were distinct tribal groups whose land holdings had been usurped by whites. Paul argued that the â€˜Tlingit' and â€˜Haida', as represented by the CCTHIA, reflected linguistic rather than tribal groupings. He believed that class action for Native lands claims must be brought by individual tribes rather than the CCTHIA. Paul helped BIA Commissioner Dillon Meyer remove Curry from the case in 1953, forcing the Tlingit and Haida to hire attorney Israel Weissbrodt. Meanwhile, Paul and his sons, despite great opposition from the ANB, brought a series of cases designed to force the courts to accept Paul's theories about the Haida and Tlingit claims. The cases culminated with Tee-Hit-Ton vs. US (1955). The Supreme Court stated that compensation could not be awarded for Native Land Claims unless recognized specifically by Congress, and rejected Paul's theory about the Tlingit and Haida. The CCTHIA was later re-organized, however, in order to reflect more accurately tribal structures in Southeast Alaska. Although considered a setback for Native rights, the Tee-Hit-Ton case did not end the Tlingit-Haida Land Claims action. The Court of Claims ruled in 1959 that the Tlingit and Haida had occupied and owned the entire area of southeast Alaska at the time the state was purchased by the US in 1867. Compensation of $7.5 million was awarded to the CCTHIA in 1968. Organizations including the ANB and the Alaska Federation of Natives International would continue meanwhile to campaign for Native land claim settlements across Alaska. Â¶ Paul moved to Seattle following the Tee-Hit-Ton case, and became gradually less active within the ANB. He adopted the role of an advisor rather than a leader within the organization. He frequently sent open letters to the ANB membership that set out his goals for the organization and his opinions of its leaders' policies. Although he was not active in the passage of the landmark 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, his sons were and corresponded with him on the matter. The settlement awarded both land and compensation to Alaskan Natives, to be administered by twelve regional corporations within the state and one outside. Paul would remain involved with Native rights issues and organizations through the final years of his life. He practiced law as late as 1972, and paid active dues to the Alaska Bar Association until 1974. William Lewis Paul died in 1977. Â¶ "

Thomson was Seattle city engineer from 1892 through 1911 and again in 1930 and 1931. He chaired the Seattle Public Works Board 1896-1911, established the Port of Seattle in 1911, served as superintendent of Stathcona Park, Vancouver Island, from 1912 to 1915, and was a member of the Seattle City Council from 1916 to 1922. Thomson consulted on major water and hydroelectric projects in Washington, Oregon, British Columbia, and Alaska. Among the many projects he is known for are several major regrades of Seattle's business district and waterfront, the establishment of Seattle's first hydroelectic plants, and establishment of the Cedar River water supply and the West Point sewage treatment plant.</p>
		<p>Early in his career, Thomson entered into a partnership with F. H. Whitworth, the city and county surveyor. One of Thomsonâ€™s early tasks as assistant surveyor involved the initial work of dredging a canal between Lake Washington and Lake Union where, decades later, he would be instrumental in constructing the Lake Washington Ship Canal connecting both lakes to Puget Sound. In 1884, Thomson became the city surveyor. In this role he built Seattleâ€™s first sewers and the Grant Street bridge across the tideflats. He resigned in 1886 to work for the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern railroad. As locating engineer, he plotted the path of the railbed from the northern end of Lake Washington all the way eastward through Snoqualmie Pass, to Lake Keechelus. Not stopping there, he moved on to Spokane for a few years where he constructed terminals and built two bridges. Once back in Seattle, he worked as a consulting engineer. Then, in 1892 he became city engineer, a job that he would hold for the next 20 years. He added 4.5 miles of sewer lines throughout the city, much of it through formations that had stymied earlier engineers. He also worked on creating the growing communityâ€™s first sidewalks and paved roads, including Lake Washington Boulevard, which he and his assistant, George F. Cotterill (1865-1958), first designed as a cinder path for bicycles.</p>
		<p>His first regrade, in 1898, was up 1st Avenue from Pike Street to Denny Way. Five years later, Pike and Pine were regraded from 2nd Avenue to Broadway. For the next eight years, Thomsonâ€™s crews pummeled Denny Hill, between 2nd and 5th Avenues, and Pike Street and Denny Way. Thomson also went after the hillock between Main and Judkins Streets and 4th and 12th Avenues. Dearborn Street was regraded, and the 12th Avenue Bridge was built to Beacon hill. He created Westlake Avenue, which provided level access to Lake Union. In all, Seattle regraded 25 miles of streets, which displaced 16 million cubic yards of dirt. This dirt was poured into the tideflats south of the city, the landfill creating a whole new industrial section for the burgeoning metropolis. When James J. Hill (1838-1916), owner of the Great Northern Railroad, established his terminus in Seattle, Thomson convinced him to bypass the waterfront's already crowded Railroad Avenue (now Alaskan Way) and establish King Street Station south of Pioneer Square. Thomson had a tunnel built beneath the city from Virginia to Washington Streets, which was leted in 1906.</p>
		<p>Seattle used to get water from a reservoir on Beacon Hill filled with water pumped from Lake Washington, but as the city grew, this system became woefully inadequate. Thomson looked towards the Cedar River Watershed as a source of freshwater for Seattle residents, located 30 miles southeast of Seattle in the foothills of the Cascade mountain range. By 1899, work on the pipeline had begun in earnest. On December 24, 1900, a test was made of the water flow to look for leaks. The system worked well enough that on January 10, 1901, water began flowing into the Volunteer Park reservoir in Seattle. More than a century later, Seattle and King County still use the Cedar River watershed.</p>
		<p>Thomson and his crew designed and built the City Light Cedar Falls hydroelectric plant, which went into operation on October 4, 1904. On January 10, 1905, electric current illuminated streetlights in Seattle, and by September 9, City Light began serving private customers, which it does to this day. At the urging of the city council, Thomson was asked to take a well-deserved vacation from all of his good work. He visited Europe, where he â€œmade examination of nearly everything connected with city life, such as water, lights, sewers, conditions accelerating city growth, citiesâ€™ fire control, municipal baths, municipal laundries, and so forth.â€</p>
		<p>From 1905 to 1915 Thomson also became president of the University of Washingtonâ€™s board of managers. During this time he also examined the flow of commerce along Seattleâ€™s waterways. This interested him so much, that he resigned as city engineer in 1911 to organize the Port of Seattle, established largely through his efforts at lobbying the state legislature. Under Thomson's direction as engineer, the Port Commission made far reaching developmental plans, many of which are still in effect. While on the commission, Thomson pushed for acquisition of Smith Cove and the foot of Bell Street for use by the Port. He advocated deepening and straightening the Duwamish River for use in the industrial area, and also campaigned in Washington D.C., for funds to build the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks.</p>
		<p>From 1916 to 1922, he was a member of the Seattle City Council, yet he continued to do engineering work. He was a consultant on the Rogue River Valley Irrigation canal, and built a hydroelectric plant in Eugene, Oregon. He was in charge of water development in Bellingham. He surveyed power-plant sites in Southeastern Alaska. He returned, temporarily, to his job as Seattle city engineer in 1930 to oversee the final work on the Diablo Dam on the Skagit River. After that, he was a consulting engineer for both the Wenatchee Metropolitan Water System and the Inter-County River Improvement Commission for Pierce and King counties. He also consulted on the construction of the Lake Washington Floating Bridge and for the foundations of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Reginald Thomson died on January 7, 1949, at the age of 92. Immediately prior to his death, he wrote his autobiography, That Man Thomson (published posthumously). </p>"

1732-002,North Cascades Conservation Council,North Cascades Conservation Council records,"The North Cascades Conservation Council (NCCC) was organized in 1957 with the mission \""to protect and preserve the North Cascades' scenic, scientific, recreational, educational, and wilderness values.\"" For the next ten years, NCCC was dedicated to its main goal, the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. It was aided by other organizations dedicated to conservation, such as the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs. Â¶ Conservation efforts targeting the North Cascades did not begin with NCCC. Concerns about the area were voiced as early as 1892, when a park proposal for Lake Chelan was presented but denounced as being against public interests. In 1937, the first formal proposal for a North Cascades National Park was submitted by the U.S. National Park Service and Owen A. Tomlinson. The proposal was impeded by opposition from the U.S. Forest Service, which had recently lost the battle over the formation of Olympic National Park. Â¶ In the mid-1950s, Grant McConnell, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focused on public land policy, raised the call for an organization to protect the North Cascades. Disturbed by the U.S. Forest Service's plans for timber sales, mining, and construction of a cross-mountain highway over Cascade Pass, McConnell convinced Polly Dyer to call a meeting at her home to discuss the threats to the North Cascades wilderness. McConnell's main objective was the formation of a single-issue conservation group dedicated to the North Cascades. Meeting attendees resisted McConnell's plan, citing the work being done on the issue by the Mountaineers Conservation Division, to which many attendees belonged. The Mountaineers Glacier Peak Subcommitee, chaired by Philip Zalesky, was also praised for its concentration on an important geographic area of the North Cascades. After the meeting, McConnell and other Sierra Club members worked to persuade North Cascades conservation leaders to form an organization. Patrick Goldsworthy was one of those leaders, and he later became the long-time president of NCCC. Â¶ Goldsworthy had proven himself to be a committed Northwest conservationist in the early 1950s. After moving to Seattle in 1952 to accept a research appointment in the University of Washington School of Medicine, he joined the Mountaineers Conservation Division and met John and Polly Dyer. Goldsworthy, together with his wife, Jane, and the Dyers, established the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club in 1954. Â¶ On March 23, 1957, during a Glacier Peak conference in Portland, Oregon, Goldsworthy and others took up the call to protect the North Cascades. Twenty-six people from Washington, Oregon, and California were present for the formation of the North Cascades Conservation Council. NCCC designated its immediate goal as the formation of the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area. Bylaws were written and officers were elected. Philip Zalesky served as president, Pat Goldsworthy as first vice-president, Una Davies as second vice-president, Polly Dyer as secretary, and Yvonne Prater as treasurer. Harvey Manning later joined the group as editor of the NCCC's newsletter. Â¶ With Patrick Goldsworthy serving as leader of both NCCC and the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Sierra Club, assistance from the national Sierra Club and its executive director, David Brower, was quickly forthcoming. The Sierra Club had begun leading its first outing trips into the North Cascades a year earlier. In 1957, the Sierra Club produced the film, The Wilderness Alps of Stehekin. Publicizing the cause of the North Cascades, the film was shown extensively by the NCCC and other conservation groups. It was also circulated to public officials and members of Congress. Â¶ The Sierra Club furthered its commitment to the Pacific Northwest in 1961 by hiring Michael McCloskey, the first Northwest Conservation representative. The representative was funded by the Federation of the Western Outdoor Clubs and served as a valuable lobbyist and advocate for the formation of national parks and wilderness areas in the Northwest. Â¶ By 1959, support for a North Cascades National Park was strong among conservation organizations, including the NCCC, the National Parks Association, the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, the Sierra Club, the Mountaineers, and the Cascadians. Conservationists called for the U.S. Forest Service to suspend its plans for timber sales and road construction, and to allow the U.S. National Park Service to conduct a study of the possible park area. Washington Congressman Thomas Pelly, a vocal advocate of conservation, asked the U.S. National Park Service to conduct the study, only to be reprimanded by the director of the U.S. Forest Service for neglecting to ask for permission. Congressman Pelly, with the assistance of the Interior Department and groups such as the NCCC, then attempted to introduce legislation to order the study, but was unsuccessful. Â¶ In 1961, Pelly was presented with a petition bearing 22,000 signatures in favor of a park study. That same year, Washington Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson also joined the debate when they encouraged Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman to develop a forest management plan for the contested areas. Freeman imposed a temporary moratorium on logging, which ended the following year, only to be asked by Pelly to impose a stricter moratorium on logging until a national park study was held. Freeman denied the request, since the U.S. Forest Service had completed a high mountain management policy for the North Cascades. Â¶ In 1963, after disputes between the U.S. Park and Forest Services were settled, a joint study of the North Cascades was announced. The study was recommended by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, and the study team was chaired by the director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Edward C. Crafts. Public hearings to introduce the study were held in Seattle, Wenatchee, and Mount Vernon. The NCCC worked diligently to ensure a majority of oral and written statements in support of park establishment. The NCCC also submitted a comprehensive 120-page plan for the park, entitled Prospectus for a North Cascades National Park. The Prospectus confirmed the NCCC's leadership in the park campaign. Â¶ The study team's report, The North Cascades, was published in October 1965, recommending the establishment of a North Cascades National Park. The Sierra Club published the influential book, The Wild Cascades: Forgotten Parkland, in 1965 as well, to draw further attention to the area. Public hearings were held in 1966 to discuss the study team's findings. On March 20, 1967, Senators Jackson and Magnuson introduced Senate Bill 1321, which established the North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The bill was passed in November, and the following year, in October 1968, the North Cascades National Park Service Complex was created by an act of Congress. Â¶ Another long struggle to which the NCCC was committed was passing the Wilderness Act. The legislative effort began in 1956 as a wilderness bill drafted by Howard Zahniser, director of the Wilderness Society. The bill called for the conservation of the nation's remaining wilderness. Despite initial opposition and numerous revisions, the Wilderness Act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. The act created the National Wilderness Preservation System and put 9.1 million acres of national forest land into the new system. It was the first wilderness protection legislation passed in the world. Â¶ The first major crisis to occur under the Wilderness Act began in 1967 with Kennecott Copper Corporation's plan to create an open-pit mine in Miners Ridge, a location inside the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area and close to Image Lake. Since Kennecott owned the mineral rights to the land, the Wilderness Act's clause regarding private ownership seemed to protect the mine's development. Under pressure from tremendous publicity and opposition by the NCCC and Washington congressmen, Kennecott decided to postpone its plans, although talk of commencing mining operations resumed in 1969 when copper prices soared. The land was later bought from Kennecott and the area protected from commercial interests. Â¶ The NCCC also participated in the debate over roadways in national parks. The Park Service program launched Mission 66 in 1956 to improve deteriorating and dangerous conditions in the national parks that largely resulted from a massive boom in visitors after World War II. Mission 66 expanded visitor capacity in the national parks to accommodate an estimated eighty million automobile tourists within ten years. The program called for adding more overnight accommodations, building visitor centers, and constructing park roads. The roadway debate continued in 1957, when the Washington State legislature authorized a survey for a cross-Cascades highway. On September 2, 1972, the highway, known as the North Cascades Highway, officially opened, to the dismay of NCCC members. Another debate began in 1961 regarding the Outdoor Advertising Act, which established billboard control along scenic highways. The NCCC called for more aggressive controls and restrictions of outdoor advertising than the controversial act established in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the Northwest. Â¶ Over the past third of a century, the NCCC has accomplished much in conservation, including the creation of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Glacier Peak Wilderness, William O. Douglas Wilderness (Cougar Lakes Wilderness Area), Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Mt. Baker Wilderness, Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, and others. The NCCC has also collaborated with British Columbia allies to block the raising of Ross Dam and to encourage the establishment of a U.S.-Canadian international park. In addition, the NCCC newsletter, The Wild Cascades, has kept its members and other conservationists informed of and dedicated to the various issues affecting the North Cascades. The North Cascades Conservation Council has been a leader in the protection and preservation of the North Cascades mountain range from the Columbia River to the U.S.-Canadian border. Â¶ "

1940-003,AFL-CIO. King County Labor Council of Washington,King County Labor Council Records,"The King County Labor Council has long been the communal decision-making body of the various union locals in King County. From the mid-1920s until the reunification of the AFL and CIO in 1955, only AFL-affiliated unions were represented on the Council. At other times, however, the vast majority of King County's locals had a voice on the Council.

The Council has passed through at least four distinct periods in its history. The Council originally began in 1888 as the Western Central Labor Union. This body changed its name to the Central Labor Council of Seattle and Vicinity in 1905. These groups occasionally joined coalitions with Populists and other reform groups in local and state politics. Nonetheless, much of the early Council's energy was spent simply trying to survive. The second phase of the Council's history began roughly in 1914 with the labor shortage that allowed unions to organize much of Seattle. The Council grew increasingly radical in this period and became the dominant force in Seattle's powerful progressive coalition. The loss of the Council's power began with the mass layoffs of shipyard workers after World War I. These layoffs led the Council to call the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the only truly city-wide general strike in American history. Employers responded to the failed strike with an open shop drive that de-unionized most of King County. A series of internal power struggles plagued the Council after the strike. The Council voted to expel members of the Industrial Workers of the World in late 1919 and Communist Party members in 1925.

The growing conservative influence in the Council was solidified when Dave Beck and his Teamsters came to dominate the group in the late 1920s. The third phase of the Council's history was thus business unionism, Beck-style. Dave Beck began his career as a driver for the Council's cooperative laundry but rapidly rose to become the chief Teamster organizer west of the Rockies. Beck used the strategic position of truck drivers in the economy to start rebuilding the strength of organized labor in Seattle. If the Council declared a firm to be \""unfair to labor,\"" he could often prevent the firm from trucking its goods to market. Despite Beck's occasionally ruthless tactics, he believed that businesses had a right to make a profit. When the Great Depression spurred widespread organizing drives, many firms concluded that they would much rather deal with the avowedly anti-radical Beck than with a CIO union. The Council routinely backed Beck in his jurisdictional disputes with CIO and independent unions. Thus, by the end of World War II, Seattle was largely a closed-shop AFL town. Under Beck's reign, the Council stayed fairly aloof from politics, endorsing moderate pro-labor Democrats and spurning the leftist coalitions that fought for local and state offices.

The fourth stage of the Council's history, its reentry into local politics, began with the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955. The expanded Council was quickly put on the defensive by statewide right-to-work proposals in Initiative 198 in 1956 and Initiative 202 in 1958. The Council played a leading role in the campaigns that defeated these measures. After these victories, the Council went on the offensive. It started a pro-labor public relations campaign in 1959 that included donating money to charities and promoting radio and television appearances by labor leaders. Beginning in 1964, the Council's Committee on Political Education launched major voter registration drives before elections. The growth of public sector unions in the 1950s and 1960s, coupled with the addition of progressive CIO unions, led the Council to endorse expanded social services and public housing in this period. The Council also supported the efforts of Seattle civil rights groups during the 1960s. Nonetheless, the Council retained some traces of business unionism. It gave a no-strike pledge during the 1962 World's Fair and often helped the Chamber of Commerce lobby for subsidies for local businesses.

During the latter years of the 20th century, the period documented in Accession 1940-2, the council's executive secretaries were, in succession: James K. Bender, Dan Bickford, Ron Judd, and Steve Williamson.

In 2005, the name changed to Martin Luther King County Labor Council, commonly referred to as MLK Labor.
